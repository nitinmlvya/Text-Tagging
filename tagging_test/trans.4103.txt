Customer 13.987250 28.060000 [silence]
Agent 18.083375 32.366750 i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now

Agent 250.645625 251.860625 um-hum
Customer 251.189375 253.321250 probably try to get back on the
Agent 251.860625 261.163625 [silence]
Customer 253.321250 258.549125 topic but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without

Agent 276.167750 287.471625 [silence]
Customer 276.759625 278.312250 i guess we'll have to
Customer 278.312250 287.955000 factor that in if we['re]- if we're not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement
Agent 287.471625 288.493000 um-hum
Customer 287.955000 291.687875 i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now it's uh
