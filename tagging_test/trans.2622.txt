Agent 1.041625 3.088375 so uh what do you think [laughter]
Agent 3.088375 5.384500 [silence]
Customer 3.459750 6.263625 i think we're overtaxed to the hilt [noise]
Agent 5.384500 6.866500 yeah
Customer 6.263625 11.472500 yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um
Agent 6.866500 24.503000 [silence]
Customer 11.472500 16.262750 uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state
Customer 16.262750 24.939375 income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through
Agent 24.503000 27.730375 oh really so they have n[o]- i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas
Customer 24.939375 27.623250 [silence]
Customer 27.623250 29.904625 no no state income tax
Agent 27.730375 28.880500 [silence]
Agent 28.880500 32.373625 oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida in New York they have it
Customer 29.904625 31.736625 [silence]
Customer 31.736625 33.045750 uh-huh
Agent 32.373625 36.403125 i mean you know like i say i'm in New York and we have a state tax as well
Customer 33.045750 38.625750 [silence]
Agent 36.403125 38.299500 so that just cuts even more
Agent 38.299500 42.682625 [silence]
Customer 38.625750 43.039500 yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits
Agent 42.682625 51.870500 right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place
Customer 43.039500 54.738125 [silence]
Agent 51.870500 55.549375 you know y[ou]- you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
Customer 54.738125 56.107000 right
Agent 55.549375 57.742250 i think if it were to be uh
Customer 56.107000 61.867625 [silence]
Agent 57.742250 59.424750 if it were to be um
Agent 59.424750 63.002250 if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door
Customer 61.867625 62.951750 yeah
Customer 62.951750 74.845000 [silence]
Agent 63.002250 65.886250 [noise]
Agent 65.886250 75.615875 if if it were to be spent in the right way i think i wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem
Customer 74.845000 76.506125 well we're
Agent 75.615875 90.069875 [silence]
Customer 76.506125 81.698875 really overburdened from federal state and local
Customer 81.698875 86.040250 that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that
Customer 86.040250 87.456750 [silence]
Customer 87.456750 90.627875 there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck
Agent 90.069875 94.681750 well that's certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um
Customer 90.627875 111.555375 [silence]
Agent 94.681750 105.696000 sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after
Agent 105.696000 112.188250 but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
Customer 111.555375 112.881125 uh-huh
Agent 112.188250 118.846500 i think tha[t]- so they want to you know try an[d]- i think they're trying i think tha[t]- i think that most of the politicians understand this
Customer 112.881125 122.957000 [silence]
Agent 118.846500 123.714500 they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
Customer 122.957000 127.677000 well they're kind of put into a trap of being
Agent 123.714500 131.354500 [silence]
Customer 127.677000 132.567625 out there to please the special interest groups as well
Agent 131.354500 132.729250 right
Customer 132.567625 140.815375 and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue
Agent 132.729250 144.743250 [silence]
Customer 140.815375 144.730250 that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
Customer 144.730250 146.072500 [silence]
Agent 144.743250 146.344875 uh-huh
Customer 146.072500 149.657500 and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody
Agent 146.344875 149.996125 [silence]
Customer 149.657500 151.590875 [silence]
Agent 149.996125 151.496500 i agree
Agent 151.496500 152.722625 i agree
Customer 151.590875 152.695000 and uh
Customer 152.695000 153.840000 [silence]
Agent 152.722625 165.766625 [silence]
Customer 153.840000 160.665750 uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is
Customer 160.665750 161.911125 [silence]
Customer 161.911125 165.739125 it's just taking uh [noise] a bite out of our savings
Customer 165.739125 179.988875 [silence]
Agent 165.766625 168.942000 right exactly and then and then uh
Agent 168.942000 180.557000 uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
Customer 179.988875 181.236000 yeah
Agent 180.557000 185.449125 you know but i'm not convinced that's a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and
Customer 181.236000 200.685875 [silence]
Agent 185.449125 197.474500 you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it
Agent 197.474500 201.048125 you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places
Customer 200.685875 205.146375 and i believe the Social Security tax is a great {pondsy} scheme
Agent 201.048125 205.149625 [silence]
Customer 205.146375 206.703875 [silence]
Agent 205.149625 206.677000 you think so
Agent 206.677000 211.693125 [silence]
Customer 206.703875 212.871250 yeah it's uh you know right now they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit
Agent 211.693125 214.998625 i know and that scares the hell out of me
Customer 212.871250 214.394750 [silence]
Customer 214.394750 221.844375 and i bet that's illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that
Agent 214.998625 224.632000 [silence]
Customer 221.844375 224.632125 within their private company they'd be in jail
Agent 224.632000 225.489625 yeah
Customer 224.632125 228.701625 [laughter] so how are we letting them get away with it
Agent 225.489625 228.175125 [silence]
Agent 228.175125 241.775500 yeah i don't i don't well becau[se]- because they're the ones who make the laws [laughter] so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess
Customer 228.701625 231.646250 [silence]
Customer 231.646250 234.669500 right [laughter]
Customer 234.669500 241.691125 [silence]
Customer 241.691125 243.046125 yeah
Agent 241.775500 247.676125 to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not
Customer 243.046125 247.000250 [silence]
Customer 247.000250 256.138000 a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and
Agent 247.676125 265.839875 [silence]
Customer 256.138000 258.268375 feel absolutely helpless
Customer 258.268375 259.577250 to
Customer 259.577250 263.991250 oppose a lot of the situations going on
Customer 263.991250 266.196750 in the taxing system
Agent 265.839875 275.290000 i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
Customer 266.196750 274.553625 [silence]
Customer 274.553625 275.891750 yeah
Agent 275.290000 280.236750 i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong
Customer 275.891750 288.481250 [silence]
Agent 280.236750 283.387000 you know all those things that really could be changed that
Agent 283.387000 289.160250 aren't you know that that that aren't and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list
Customer 288.481250 289.868750 yeah
Agent 289.160250 290.926750 [silence]
Customer 289.868750 290.997750 hum
Agent 290.926750 294.080375 so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it
Customer 290.997750 293.537250 [silence]
Customer 293.537250 298.438250 well there's no quick solution or no sure fire
Agent 294.080375 326.830750 [silence]
Customer 298.438250 300.220250 easy answer
Customer 300.220250 302.453000 it's just going to take uh
Customer 302.453000 303.473750 [silence]
Customer 303.473750 306.425750 uh really uh uh uh
Customer 306.425750 311.312750 a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to
Customer 311.312750 312.369875 [silence]
Customer 312.369875 316.403375 come to a decisive answer
Customer 316.403375 318.183750 or
Customer 318.183750 320.317625 vote
Customer 320.317625 322.159375 to
Customer 322.159375 324.690375 limit
Customer 324.690375 327.010250 the way it's spent
Agent 326.830750 327.891250 yeah
Customer 327.010250 332.911750 see we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place that's
Agent 327.891250 330.601125 [silence]
Agent 330.601125 337.073625 right we don't i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
Customer 332.911750 336.293375 [silence]
Customer 336.293375 340.385125 right and they are controlled or
Agent 337.073625 342.776875 [silence]
Customer 340.385125 343.435250 pretty much do what they want to do
Agent 342.776875 344.010875 right
Customer 343.435250 369.384000 [silence]
Agent 344.010875 350.000375 i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um um i i've never been
Agent 350.000375 354.515000 uh sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of
Agent 354.515000 355.534875 um
Agent 355.534875 362.968375 you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas
Agent 362.968375 367.006250 when clearly their constituency doe[s]- doesn't back them up on anything you know
Agent 367.006250 369.224625 and often times that will happen
Agent 369.224625 372.095375 [silence]
Customer 369.384000 373.770125 well they feel invu[lnerable]- invulnerable to uh
Agent 372.095375 372.948250 right
Agent 372.948250 385.567000 [silence]
Customer 373.770125 379.340625 any wrath or uh it's it's occurred so many times that
Customer 379.340625 382.940250 they figure people will usually forget and
Customer 382.940250 386.305375 don't think about it when the election time arises
Agent 385.567000 387.029875 right
Customer 386.305375 387.380125 [silence]
Agent 387.029875 389.394500 [silence]
Customer 387.380125 390.255125 and generally it does work out that way
Agent 389.394500 403.280500 they do forget it's true coul[d]- because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politic[ian]- whenever th[e]- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
Customer 390.255125 402.619125 [silence]
Customer 402.619125 403.908750 uh-huh
Agent 403.280500 405.106750 so it becomes uh
Customer 403.908750 410.672625 [silence]
Agent 405.106750 407.214250 a general battle of
Agent 407.214250 411.232750 the w[ho]- um the uh sort of election of the lesser of two evils
Customer 410.672625 411.953125 yeah
Agent 411.232750 412.414000 i think so
Customer 411.953125 427.021250 [silence]
Agent 412.414000 413.934125 i don't know
Agent 413.934125 420.950375 i just uh i'm unhappy with it but and well i'm i'm sort of semi fortunate right now i'm a graduate student
Agent 420.950375 427.244125 so i don't make that much and what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school
Customer 427.021250 430.004375 well when you get out into the real world then you will know
Agent 427.244125 428.250000 but
Agent 428.250000 429.390000 it's
Agent 429.390000 439.412625 my my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
Customer 430.004375 439.226500 [silence]
Customer 439.226500 440.654000 yeah
Agent 439.412625 441.309500 [silence]
Customer 440.654000 443.055500 [silence]
Agent 441.309500 443.686625 especially around bonus time
Customer 443.055500 444.889500 bonus time you have a bonus
Agent 443.686625 446.917750 bonus she no my my wife does
Customer 444.889500 446.183500 [silence]
Customer 446.183500 448.053625 oh [laughter]
Agent 446.917750 451.715875 my wi[fe]- i don['t]- no graduate students don't get bonuses we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure
Customer 448.053625 449.125375 [silence]
Customer 449.125375 450.148125 uh-huh
Customer 450.148125 451.424000 [silence]
Customer 451.424000 454.773000 so you're taxed on the bonuses too right
Agent 451.715875 453.140875 [silence]
Agent 453.140875 456.683875 my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a
Customer 454.773000 459.450000 [silence]
Agent 456.683875 465.067250 that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if
Customer 459.450000 461.094750 uh-huh
Customer 461.094750 467.988500 [silence]
Agent 465.067250 468.466750 that were her weekly check or something
Customer 467.988500 469.241875 uh-huh
Agent 468.466750 471.205875 so she gets destroyed on her bonus check
Customer 469.241875 471.059375 [silence]
Customer 471.059375 472.312750 uh-huh
Agent 471.205875 474.761500 so she works with in in in sales
Customer 472.312750 480.338500 [silence]
Agent 474.761500 480.125875 so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses
Agent 480.125875 485.309000 [silence]
Customer 480.338500 485.965875 uh sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job
Agent 485.309000 493.849000 yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily
Customer 485.965875 493.122375 [silence]
Customer 493.122375 494.546125 uh-huh
Agent 493.849000 497.000375 until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more
Customer 494.546125 504.652000 [silence]
Agent 497.000375 502.997250 so i don't know i d[on't]- i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it
Agent 502.997250 504.983250 and hope that it gets better
Customer 504.652000 506.065000 yeah
Agent 504.983250 512.814625 [silence]
