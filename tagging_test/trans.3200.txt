Agent 0.000000 3.258750 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 4.155500 [noise] okay i'll let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours [laughter]
Agent 3.258750 10.878750 no i- i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible
Customer 4.155500 7.883750 [silence]
Customer 7.883750 9.247000 um-hum
Customer 9.247000 13.973625 well that's that's good [laughter] especially for these times
Agent 10.878750 17.106125 and uh and it's it's sort sort of always worked
Customer 13.973625 16.374250 [silence]
Customer 16.374250 17.825500 uh-huh
Agent 17.106125 21.408250 uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can
Customer 17.825500 22.929875 [silence]
Agent 21.408250 23.604875 [laughter] i guess have self control
Customer 22.929875 34.861750 well that's a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system
Agent 23.604875 34.389125 [silence]
Agent 34.389125 35.949375 um-hum
Customer 34.861750 47.266125 where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason
Agent 35.949375 58.452500 [silence]
Customer 47.266125 51.014000 taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form
Customer 51.014000 62.257750 uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period
Agent 58.452500 59.215500 uh-huh
Agent 59.215500 65.645625 [silence]
Customer 62.257750 77.081500 if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about
Agent 65.645625 67.116375 um-hum
Agent 67.116375 76.113750 [silence]
Agent 76.113750 77.525125 yes
Customer 77.081500 85.079125 and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month
Agent 77.525125 85.449125 [silence]
Customer 85.079125 88.529125 [silence]
Agent 85.449125 89.277125 well yeah i- i couldn't probably be bothered d[oing]- doing that
Customer 88.529125 92.018875 uh-huh [noise] that's what i mean it was a hassle [laughter]
Agent 89.277125 97.744875 every month and and every since uh well we've been married almost thirty years now but um m[y]- my husband got paid once a month
Customer 92.018875 93.791750 [silence]
Customer 93.791750 95.124000 um-hum
Customer 95.124000 97.068125 [silence]
Customer 97.068125 98.659375 um-hum
Agent 97.744875 105.791125 so [laughter] you learn to get th[rough]- [laughter] you learn to get through you know to the end of the month and uh
Customer 98.659375 102.021000 [laughter-that's] that's kind of hard [laughter]
Customer 102.021000 104.613500 [noise]
Customer 104.613500 113.969250 but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you
Agent 105.791125 109.972375 [silence]
Agent 109.972375 123.760875 no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway
Customer 113.969250 117.821500 [silence]
Customer 117.821500 119.087375 right
Customer 119.087375 121.038750 [silence]
Customer 121.038750 122.313875 right
Customer 122.313875 123.342625 [silence]
Customer 123.342625 128.909125 well that's true what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely
Agent 123.760875 125.854750 [laughter]
Agent 125.854750 128.209125 [silence]
Agent 128.209125 129.851625 um-hum
Customer 128.909125 134.979750 and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next [laughter-month]
Agent 129.851625 134.092125 [silence]
Agent 134.092125 137.513625 well yeah we we tried to to
Customer 134.979750 137.126125 [laughter-and]
Customer 137.126125 138.738250 [silence]
Agent 137.513625 148.607000 t[o]- or we are paying them_1 off now or there was a time when maybe we didn't pay all of them_1 off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is
Customer 138.738250 140.955750 yeah we're not there yet
Customer 140.955750 142.192750 [silence]
Customer 142.192750 143.622125 um-hum
Customer 143.622125 145.765375 uh-huh
Customer 145.765375 149.199250 that's right that's right
Agent 148.607000 158.929375 and for most of uh i mean i'm a substitute teacher and i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so there's only been really one working [noise] and uh [noise]
Customer 149.199250 154.036000 [silence]
Customer 154.036000 155.512125 um
Customer 155.512125 157.864625 um-hum same here yeah
Customer 157.864625 163.500375 [silence]
Agent 158.929375 164.526250 it it works for me but i can't see that it it would work for probably the majority of people
Customer 163.500375 169.067875 well i could say it's kind of you know that's that's good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have
Agent 164.526250 169.580750 [silence]
Customer 169.067875 177.106375 to you know what i'm saying and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday
Agent 169.580750 170.951750 yeah
Agent 170.951750 172.505750 [silence]
Agent 172.505750 173.509000 [noise]
Agent 173.509000 187.980000 [silence]
Customer 177.106375 184.562875 then i think if we could really budget we tried one ti[me]- i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years
Customer 184.562875 191.167000 we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener
Agent 187.980000 190.236375 um-hum yeah
Agent 190.236375 193.430125 um-hum it it is when you do it that way
Customer 191.167000 199.424500 [vocalized-noise] [laughter] uh-huh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because_1 sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out
Agent 193.430125 204.281250 [silence]
Customer 199.424500 208.102625 so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you
Agent 204.281250 217.371625 well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i- i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks
Customer 208.102625 209.526375 [silence]
Customer 209.526375 211.608375 yeah yeah
Customer 211.608375 213.172750 [silence]
Customer 213.172750 216.689125 right [laughter] right
Customer 216.689125 220.980500 oh how nice
Agent 217.371625 229.480000 ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the [laughter-what] minuscule amount i made but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card and and it was paid for
Customer 220.980500 222.990000 uh-huh
Customer 222.990000 224.070125 [silence]
Customer 224.070125 226.984875 [laughter] with
Customer 226.984875 232.451500 well that's g[ood]- and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah [vocalized-noise]
Agent 229.480000 241.491875 yes and so i think that that's difficult for most people but then my father was very Scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um
Customer 232.451500 233.853250 [silence]
Customer 233.853250 236.120500 i think so too
Customer 236.120500 240.230500 [silence]
Customer 240.230500 251.364750 so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that that's excellent that's what i'm working toward i think you're probably much ahead of me there and i'm working on it
Agent 241.491875 245.134000 [silence]
Agent 245.134000 246.558875 yes
Agent 246.558875 250.557375 [silence]
Agent 250.557375 256.469125 and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so
Customer 251.364750 255.049875 [silence]
Customer 255.049875 264.207750 same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get [laughter] you know yeah
Agent 256.469125 257.967500 i uh
Agent 257.967500 261.381500 [silence]
Agent 261.381500 262.729125 um-hum
Agent 262.729125 268.035125 well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh
Customer 264.207750 265.716375 yeah
Customer 265.716375 267.000000 [silence]
Customer 267.000000 269.137750 that came up yeah
Agent 268.035125 275.797500 and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my we're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars
Customer 269.137750 275.074250 [silence]
Customer 275.074250 276.798125 uh-huh
Agent 275.797500 278.232000 and they were mainly used cars
Customer 276.798125 286.025875 well that's the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after so
Agent 278.232000 282.707250 [silence]
Agent 282.707250 288.054125 yeah so you know we've been [laughter-rather] rather frugal in that
Customer 286.025875 295.685000 rather frugal well that that's gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess we've completed do you think we've been here ten
Agent 288.054125 289.323750 [silence]
Agent 289.323750 291.499375 in that respect yeah
Agent 291.499375 294.717375 [silence]
Agent 294.717375 299.522000 [noise] well ea[ch]- each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh
Customer 295.685000 299.522000 [silence]
