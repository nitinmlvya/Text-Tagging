Agent 295.586000 296.830375 it's
Customer 295.760375 306.065375 i don't know but if i were to rank them_1 i guess i would say next to income it's really just health benefits and then um for most people i know it would be day care like TI has no day care
Agent 296.830375 303.944000 [silence]
Agent 303.944000 305.304625 right
Agent 305.304625 316.640750 yeah that and i know that's a big issue because i i belong to a women's forum group and some of the questions we're getting are are on site day care and things like that that

Customer 316.647500 324.262000 [silence]
Customer 324.262000 330.982625 oh i do[n't]- i would think so yeah because_1 my husband yeah they really should because_1 they're big enough um

Agent 328.115375 340.488750 [silence]
Customer 330.982625 344.753625 and the other thing i think is really good is that EDS is much better than TI at i think right now that that we have day care um they uh the health the h[ealth]- the health program like TI has Texans but it i don't think it that it's
Agent 340.488750 344.045375 uh-huh right
Agent 344.045375 346.939125 [silence]
Customer 344.753625 348.265000 developed as much as it could be for the size company as TI
Agent 346.939125 348.769000 right
Customer 348.265000 359.031500 i mean if you ever walked into EDS's health quote unquote health clubs on site [laughter] and you walk into Spring Creek well Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway but i mean yeah but
