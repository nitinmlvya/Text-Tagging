Customer 110.493625 125.997500 [silence]
Agent 113.494625 127.770625 that you know because_1 i mean look look in Dallas they're everywhere they were everywhere and then then they started being taken over by bigger bigger ones and then they just the bigger ones took on the little one's debt and then it it just snowballed
Customer 125.997500 131.474750 and that's probably another cause of the problem we are looking at right now
Agent 127.770625 129.674000 [silence]
Agent 129.674000 138.493875 yeah it's it it there's just it just seemed like everybody and their brother had a savings and loan [laughter]
Customer 131.474750 136.801875 [silence]
Customer 136.801875 140.740875 this is a very true thing i didn't think about that part of it

Agent 199.505375 203.708000 [silence]
Agent 203.708000 212.835625 because if he only stole six stole six hundred thousand dollars that's just a drop in the bucket compared to some of them_1 that were were skimming millions
Customer 205.697125 212.269125 [silence]
Customer 212.269125 218.959625 yeah because that's a drop in the bucket to the taxes we're going to have to pay to to make up for this
Agent 212.835625 214.124625 [silence]
Agent 214.124625 217.279750 yeah yeah because_1
Agent 217.279750 223.444250 there are bigger fish i know i mean otherwise it wouldn't be in such a mess
Customer 218.959625 232.457125 [silence]
Agent 223.444250 237.489125 that the the stealing because_1 uh stealing and leaving the country probably they ca[n't]- they probably can't find them [laughter-what] [laughter-the] [laughter-deal] [laughter-is] [laughter] oh

Customer 251.996750 253.978375 [silence]
Customer 253.978375 268.468750 and the other thing is they said the insur[ance]- the uh insurance agents the insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry so they they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance
Agent 254.766750 262.232375 [silence]

Customer 317.216500 322.615625 well i you know the problem is who is they and you get they is the government
Agent 319.049250 320.835500 [silence]
Agent 320.835500 324.603250 the government yeah that's what i meant Congress
Customer 322.615625 323.772250 [silence]
Customer 323.772250 331.011375 but you get you get into when you start getting them to do things you get into a lot of special interest groups again
Agent 324.603250 328.668000 [silence]
Agent 328.668000 335.297125 yes exac[tly]- exactly and lobbying oh you know there's a big
Customer 331.011375 333.169000 and you know
Customer 333.169000 341.493250 and and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would that offer new opportunities for other people
Agent 335.297125 339.989875 [silence]
Agent 339.989875 343.358875 yeah that's true that's true
Customer 341.493250 351.967750 that's what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are going to change it watch out for the person that's changing it they may put another loophole in that
Agent 343.358875 344.736000 [silence]
Agent 344.736000 346.292125 um-hum
Agent 346.292125 348.247875 [silence]

Customer 354.763625 361.962625 [silence]
Customer 361.962625 374.481250 and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers that's the problem with the news both the on television and the paper
Agent 362.775750 365.785375 [silence]

Agent 385.992250 389.206375 [silence]
Agent 389.206375 397.481250 yeah yeah [vocalized-noise] we got these people up in Washington deciding all this stuff for us and we don't even know what they're deciding

Agent 414.535375 423.714875 yeah but i'm it's one of those one of those things that i just don't know where the answer lies
Customer 416.204500 435.698000 [silence]
Agent 423.714875 436.993625 it's just it's just it's going to uh it it doesn't seem like it's going as badly as it did in the past few years it's kind of slow because_1 the closings has kind of slowed a little bit
