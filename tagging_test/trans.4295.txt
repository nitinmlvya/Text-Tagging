Agent 0.000000 0.908375 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 5.021500 [noise] i've got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our money's worth
Agent 0.908375 15.596875 [silence]
Customer 5.021500 20.597500 um primarily uh i think the one big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste
Agent 15.596875 16.902250 um-hum
Agent 16.902250 19.342125 [silence]
Agent 19.342125 22.863500 it's about uh twenty percent of the federal budget isn't it at this moment
Customer 20.597500 21.268250 [silence]
Customer 21.268250 26.600125 it's terrible you know it's huge i have no idea what the actual number really is but it
Agent 22.863500 25.261875 [silence]
Agent 25.261875 30.509625 but you can't unfortunately you can't do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and
Customer 26.600125 32.874625 [silence]
Agent 30.509625 35.088125 not at this point in the business cycle you can't
Customer 32.874625 43.462750 yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow
Agent 35.088125 40.717125 [silence]
Agent 40.717125 41.969500 yeah
Agent 41.969500 55.891875 yeah i would agree with that it was we were actually in twenty years ago we were not in bad shape we had we had been in pretty bad shape after World War Two and then we paid off some of the debt of or at least we inflated it away which is probably more what happened and uh
Customer 43.462750 54.255500 [silence]
Customer 54.255500 56.029250 [laughter]
Agent 55.891875 69.730750 then at the end of the Johnson Administration the budget Nixon's first year that was that was uh set up by Johnson was balanced and that was the last balanced budget we've got well of course part of the problem is that that um
Customer 56.029250 65.573125 [silence]
Customer 65.573125 66.875375 hum
Customer 66.875375 81.075875 [silence]
Agent 69.730750 74.475875 the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it
Agent 74.475875 84.532375 is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit
Customer 81.075875 83.079375 yeah absolutely
Customer 83.079375 88.965000 [silence]
Agent 84.532375 96.272250 i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions w[e]-
Customer 88.965000 90.676125 yeah absolutely
Customer 90.676125 94.229875 [silence]
Customer 94.229875 98.010875 and th[at's]- that's a terrible problem as well
Agent 96.272250 97.523625 [noise]
Agent 97.523625 107.040625 we need more programs to well i mean for example a tax reform law okay a so called tax reform of nineteen eighty six began as a tax simplification law
Customer 98.010875 115.646625 [silence]
Agent 107.040625 119.130875 which would've made it easier to enforce and would've saved us i mean another way that they in effect increase your taxes is by increasing the amount that you have to pay to get them prepared or the amount of time you need to take to get your records in order
Customer 115.646625 119.937000 um-hum um-hum
Agent 119.130875 131.952125 and the eighty six tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were Ronald Reagan i would've said unless that reduces the size of the IRS code by thirty percent i'm going to veto it
Customer 119.937000 132.378125 [silence]
Agent 131.952125 140.696000 [silence]
Customer 132.378125 141.709000 well as much as that's a bad thing i think that uh there's some other really major major things that need straightened out and you'd mentioned waste a little while ago
Agent 140.696000 142.065000 um-hum
Customer 141.709000 153.041000 and uh i've seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out
Agent 142.065000 160.716125 [silence]
Customer 153.041000 160.163500 to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasn't going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts
Customer 160.163500 174.192750 that company said they'd go ahead and build these things and they didn't build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in
Agent 160.716125 161.650250 [noise]
Agent 161.650250 176.131250 [silence]
Customer 174.192750 177.577750 front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there
Agent 176.131250 183.161625 another thing that that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to people who work at AT&T Gilford Center
Customer 177.577750 182.731750 [silence]
Customer 182.731750 184.151625 uh-huh
Agent 183.161625 197.585875 and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the Navy i'm not sure what it's called [vocalized-noise] called but it's some uh military standard architecture with a with a sixteen bit address space i mean they're still working with a sixteen bit address space
Customer 184.151625 196.372125 [silence]
Customer 196.372125 197.732125 uh no
Agent 197.585875 206.099375 and they're writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago
Customer 197.732125 215.839625 [silence]
Agent 206.099375 216.258500 i don't know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but you'd think at some stage they'd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current
Customer 215.839625 226.453750 yeah i really wish there was some solution to this [vocalized-noise] bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of administration or administrative thing that gets so big
Agent 216.258500 224.001500 [silence]
Agent 224.001500 230.249250 well the Republican solution is to cut taxes
Customer 226.453750 242.799500 [silence]
Agent 230.249250 244.576750 and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesn't solve it we haven't gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the savings and loan debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result it's gotten worse but uh
Customer 242.799500 244.126250 um
Customer 244.126250 252.450250 not limiting taxes di[dn't]- hasn't stopped uh the government from spending they just went ahead and spent it and now we've got this giant deficit on top of things
Agent 244.576750 250.703000 [silence]
Agent 250.703000 252.267875 that's right that's right
Agent 252.267875 264.020750 um so i- i- i don't know i mean th[ere]- th[ere]- there's only three things you can do you you can you can cut programs you can raise taxes or you can cut waste and at the moment people don't want programs cut although
Customer 252.450250 254.465250 [silence]
Customer 254.465250 255.604375 [noise]
Customer 255.604375 283.620875 [silence]
Agent 264.020750 279.018500 uh i'm not sure that some of them shouldn't be looked at more carefully pro[grams]- uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to families with dependent children that appears to create an incentive for unmarried women to have more kids
Agent 279.018500 286.277250 uh i'm a little concerned about that i'm a little concerned [laughter-about] cutting it out too because they might just end up aborting all of them
Customer 283.620875 287.483750 uh-huh uh-huh
Agent 286.277250 298.946000 but uh there's th[ere]- th[ere]- you know Governor Thompson of Wisconsin has an idea which is pay the fathers of these children to marry the mothers and at least that way you get you get the mother you know the fathers to take up some of the some of
Customer 287.483750 294.312750 [silence]
Customer 294.312750 298.946000 [laughter]
