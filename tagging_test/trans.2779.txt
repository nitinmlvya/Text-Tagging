Agent 0.000000 3.778125 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.254500 [noise]
Customer 0.254500 4.222375 now we have to talk about the savings and loans scandal [laughter]
Agent 3.778125 5.187375 oh my goodness
Customer 4.222375 4.795250 [silence]
Customer 4.795250 5.255375 [noise]
Agent 5.187375 6.094375 [silence]
Customer 5.255375 6.807250 [silence]
Agent 6.094375 6.947000 yes
Customer 6.807250 9.833625 do you have any strong opinions on that
Agent 6.947000 9.674500 [silence]

Customer 9.833625 10.593250 [silence]
Customer 10.593250 11.981625 uh what are yours
Agent 11.288000 11.866125 [silence]
Agent 11.866125 15.716125 i i think uh it's all Congress' fault
Customer 11.981625 15.120375 [silence]
Customer 15.120375 25.936000 well i think there's a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water
Agent 15.716125 25.794000 [silence]
Agent 25.794000 32.891875 yep and i think the real problem wasn't the regulation which i supported but that they failed to similarly deregulate the insurance
Customer 25.936000 32.551375 [silence]
Customer 32.551375 33.718000 um
Agent 32.891875 43.585000 i mean i think that was the real mistake they should have seen that coming it's that was like giving away free money oh sure we'll continue to in[sure]- insure you cheaply but you can you know do whatever you want with the way you loan the money
Customer 33.718000 34.730625 [silence]
Customer 34.730625 35.708375 well
Customer 35.708375 42.989000 [silence]
Customer 42.989000 44.138625 right
Agent 43.585000 51.240500 and it should've been do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and by the way when you buy insurance you know they're going to be looking at how you do it
Customer 44.138625 49.163875 [silence]
Customer 49.163875 50.521750 he'll pay for it
Customer 50.521750 52.049250 absolutely
Agent 51.240500 51.892250 [silence]
Agent 51.892250 56.260750 right and then the guys who want to spend it that way sure they'll pay more for insurance
Customer 52.049250 53.148375 that
Customer 53.148375 55.347750 [silence]
Customer 55.347750 66.013000 uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that [noise] the people who were going to use the money
Agent 56.260750 67.737750 [silence]
Customer 66.013000 67.810125 that we were providing
Agent 67.737750 68.676000 yep
Customer 67.810125 73.539250 should've had there own at stake they should've have a lot more of their own capital on the line
Agent 68.676000 73.245000 [silence]
Agent 73.245000 74.362125 um-hum
Customer 73.539250 82.487625 when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and it's turning out to be a lot more than that
Agent 74.362125 82.161375 [silence]
Agent 82.161375 83.514875 right
Customer 82.487625 91.969250 and [vocalized-noise] they have absolutely no incentive to uh treat it prudently they just uh hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it
Agent 83.514875 91.663375 [silence]
Agent 91.663375 93.109625 absolutely
Customer 91.969250 95.256000 [silence]
Agent 93.109625 96.136625 absolutely because_1 i mean their return is guaranteed
Customer 95.256000 96.351625 um-hum
Agent 96.136625 98.908125 [silence]
Customer 96.351625 102.546625 they have nothing to lose and everything to gain you see you know can keep lending and keep growing
Agent 98.908125 100.053375 yeah
Agent 100.053375 102.217875 [silence]
Agent 102.217875 103.246625 right
Customer 102.546625 110.093750 then they can take the big salaries and have the all the perks and uh entertainment and so forth and then
Agent 103.246625 107.375500 [silence]
Agent 107.375500 108.420250 um-hum
Agent 108.420250 109.478500 [silence]
Agent 109.478500 110.398125 um-hum
Customer 110.093750 114.740500 oh if people don't pay them back it's no skin off their nose they just
Agent 110.398125 113.833875 [silence]
Agent 113.833875 116.641000 sure in fact they've got a strong incentive to uh
Customer 114.740500 123.628375 [silence]
Agent 116.641000 124.398375 you know guarantee your money your deposits at six percent and go ahead and invest it in you know the junkiest bonds possible where the theoretical rate of return is high
Customer 123.628375 124.652000 um-hum
Agent 124.398375 130.838750 uh because if they win they win big and if they don't who cares [laughter] they don't loose right
Customer 124.652000 127.910125 [silence]
Customer 127.910125 130.211750 yes they don't they don't lose anything
Customer 130.211750 140.677625 well uh i don't know what could've been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um
Agent 130.838750 149.472625 [silence]
Customer 140.677625 151.000250 i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told up-front that that was was was the limit
Agent 149.472625 153.180250 yep yep i agree with you there too uh
Customer 151.000250 152.069375 [silence]
Customer 152.069375 154.788500 because uh the promise is [vocalized-noise]
Agent 153.180250 157.343375 this this the whole concept of too big to fail it's just silly
Customer 154.788500 155.860500 [silence]
Customer 155.860500 158.449625 yeah the promises don't mean anything now
Agent 157.343375 158.169375 [silence]
Agent 158.169375 159.201875 yep
Customer 158.449625 163.538875 when the uh people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation
Agent 159.201875 163.351750 [silence]
Agent 163.351750 164.531625 right
Customer 163.538875 167.092500 uh they figure the tax payers will bail them out because they have
Agent 164.531625 167.151625 [silence]
Customer 167.092500 173.126250 [silence]
Agent 167.151625 175.113125 that's right and i also think the first thing they should've clarified was that the tax payer would give you a hundred thousand dollar maximum i don't care how many accounts you've got
Customer 173.126250 173.921250 hm
Customer 173.921250 174.631125 [silence]
Customer 174.631125 175.743625 absolutely
Agent 175.113125 184.981375 [silence]
Customer 175.743625 176.796625 [silence]
Customer 176.796625 179.953875 uh i would've been in a little danger of
Customer 179.953875 186.224250 uh you know i would've had to be very careful about where i put my money but i certainly would have
Agent 184.981375 186.061000 right
Agent 186.061000 191.311625 [silence]
Customer 186.224250 191.575625 been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return
Agent 191.311625 195.027000 that's right and i mean it would've put these money brokers out of business
Customer 191.575625 193.294500 on a CD
Customer 193.294500 194.270375 [silence]
Customer 194.270375 205.683500 yeah uh i don't think that'd be any great loss [laughter] we could do without a few of [laughter-those] they don't seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people
Agent 195.027000 198.742375 which i mean certainly contributed um-hum
Agent 198.742375 199.838875 [silence]
Agent 199.838875 201.055500 yep
Agent 201.055500 204.023500 [silence]
Agent 204.023500 205.204375 um-hum
Agent 205.204375 217.985250 i mean if you invest in stocks or whatever you know it's it's not just the responsibility of the broker it's your responsibility you know to know what you're investing in and the kinds of risks you're taking and it seems to me if you're going to put more than a hundred thousand dollars or whatever the limit's going to be
Customer 205.683500 213.173750 [silence]
Customer 213.173750 214.548625 absolutely
Customer 214.548625 234.640000 [silence]
Agent 217.985250 231.896250 in a bank that you should be aware i mean it's one thing to have insurance when you're protecting the little guy who doesn't have the time to make or the expertise to make these sorts of decisions but it's another thing to be you know supposedly you would think hope that the big depositors like
Agent 231.896250 235.985250 voters and everybody else are supposed to be educated about what they're getting into
Customer 234.640000 235.776875 um-hum
Customer 235.776875 246.232250 yes you would and uh uh i don't see why the for large sums of money why it should be any different from investing in a CD i- i mean in a
Agent 235.985250 247.874500 [silence]
Customer 246.232250 250.940500 uh mutual fund or a money market fund or something like that
Agent 247.874500 251.172000 right absolutely
Customer 250.940500 253.017375 uh there are no guarantees on them
Agent 251.172000 252.935875 [silence]
Agent 252.935875 254.343500 that's right
Customer 253.017375 254.064125 [silence]
Customer 254.064125 258.113625 you uh you trust that the broker won't sell because certain
Agent 254.343500 270.396250 [silence]
Customer 258.113625 270.385125 brokerage houses will guarantee at least up to a certain point the investments in the funds that they manage but uh then you're uh just at the mercy of them because they could go under
Customer 270.385125 272.028250 [silence]
Agent 270.396250 272.275750 that's right yeah
Customer 272.028250 273.671500 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 272.275750 285.782875 yeah i mean there is like for the brokerage houses there is a degree of insurance that the brokerage won't go bankrupt and you'll lose your money but there's certainly no guarantee that for example uh the commercial paper that the money market you invest in won't become worthless and your and your stock price will go down
Customer 273.671500 283.589875 [silence]
Customer 283.589875 284.743750 that's right
Customer 284.743750 286.247375 yeah
Agent 285.782875 287.374500 and that's fair enough
Customer 286.247375 295.372125 um-hum [noise] well uh do you think that we're heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry
Agent 287.374500 295.376500 [silence]
Customer 295.372125 301.310125 [silence]
Agent 295.376500 301.815375 uh yes i mean there's got to be long long term consequences over this you know just because
Customer 301.310125 302.905875 and we see
Agent 301.815375 306.689625 reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their
Customer 302.905875 310.247375 [silence]
Agent 306.689625 314.241500 accounts that were these you know savings and loans and stuff right um so i mean this things just got to spread
Customer 310.247375 311.544125 um-hum
Customer 311.544125 314.012250 [silence]
Customer 314.012250 322.692375 well i don't know how we're going to bail them out because if we're already how many trillion dollars in the hole where's the money going to come from
Agent 314.241500 320.797500 [silence]
Agent 320.797500 321.867750 um-hum
Agent 321.867750 322.976875 [silence]
Customer 322.692375 323.665125 [silence]
Agent 322.976875 323.657875 yep
Agent 323.657875 345.519000 [silence]
Customer 323.665125 332.977125 and yet the we've got this enormous uh first executive insurance company just sailing out here in California and um
Customer 332.977125 345.338000 maybe the people who uh bought term insurance aren't going to lose anything except a few months premium but all those um people who have money invested in uh uh annuities
Customer 345.338000 350.994875 for their retirement are going to be up a creek and i don't know who's going to bail them out
Agent 345.519000 346.717875 um-hum
Agent 346.717875 348.006500 um
Agent 348.006500 351.189500 [silence]
Customer 350.994875 351.797875 [silence]
Agent 351.189500 353.241750 yep it's a problem
Customer 351.797875 362.410000 there al[ready]- there already a few companies that had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time
Agent 353.241750 362.275375 [silence]

Customer 362.410000 364.142625 [silence]
Agent 363.538500 371.637625 [silence]
Customer 364.142625 372.018000 and the the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those people but how are we going to do that
Agent 371.637625 372.952875 um-hum
Customer 372.018000 384.159875 where the state itself is already in hock uh we're running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for the next fiscal year
Agent 372.952875 390.039125 [silence]
Customer 384.159875 393.674875 and you know we've got to come up with that money because_1 states can't run a deficit the way the federal government can and they're going to have to be laying people off out here in the state
Agent 390.039125 391.361500 um-hum
Agent 391.361500 397.617250 [silence]
Customer 393.674875 402.274375 some of [laughter-whom] i [laughter-don't] think anybody will [laughter-miss] but when it gets down to teachers and cops it make a difference
Agent 397.617250 398.835250 yeah
Agent 398.835250 402.605625 [silence]

Agent 417.401125 418.681125 yeah
Agent 418.681125 428.392875 [silence]
Customer 422.904625 428.755750 i think it's something like twenty five uh people on the payroll per a legislator
Agent 428.392875 429.730875 hm
Customer 428.755750 443.217750 yeah i i came fr[om]- out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires and people
Agent 429.730875 442.633375 [silence]
Agent 442.633375 443.789250 hm

Agent 455.541500 456.857750 um-hum
Customer 455.757000 466.510000 tha[t]- i- i think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation and let things settle down maybe we could figure out what exactly we need and start over
Agent 456.857750 466.304875 [silence]
