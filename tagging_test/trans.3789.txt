Customer 261.078000 267.283875 [silence]
Agent 264.328125 268.699500 would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year
Customer 267.283875 269.448375 wow that's a lot
Agent 268.699500 277.426375 and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that

Customer 282.994000 286.054500 [silence]
Customer 286.054500 288.865000 yeah that w[orks]- that works out pretty handy
Agent 287.184875 293.980875 and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick
Customer 288.865000 290.452625 [silence]
Customer 290.452625 291.672000 uh-huh
Customer 291.672000 293.226875 [silence]
