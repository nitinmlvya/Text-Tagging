Agent 0.000000 0.970875 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.317375 [noise]
Customer 0.317375 10.269750 oh i just want to know do tax payers get what they get back what they what they uh put into i kind of doubt it because_1 of because_1 of the latest check writing scandal [laughter]
Agent 0.970875 16.469000 [silence]
Customer 10.269750 16.999375 [laughter] i should have such good uh such such good use of of the public fund
Agent 16.469000 17.763625 okay
Customer 16.999375 19.994875 uh i don't know what do you think
Agent 17.763625 20.992500 [silence]
Customer 19.994875 42.446000 [silence]
Agent 20.992500 26.036625 well it seems like its a tremendous pressure to
Agent 26.036625 33.807000 uh reduce taxes and reduce government spending but that uh somehow it just seems to go up and up
Agent 33.807000 43.175500 and [noise] seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i don't quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization
Customer 42.446000 45.479625 [laughter]
Agent 43.175500 44.223125 [noise]
Agent 44.223125 54.050875 centralization is suppose to um improve efficiency but i somehow i have a feeling it it uh reduces efficiency
Customer 45.479625 53.747375 [silence]
Customer 53.747375 67.995125 well it sort of i- i thinking more like the purest principle being at work you know managers such as manag[er]- managers in particularly managers bureaucracies exist to
Agent 54.050875 70.984000 [silence]
Customer 67.995125 72.239250 uh seek seek to multiply subordinates and not rivals
Agent 70.984000 72.805750 [noise]
Customer 72.239250 73.995000 so
Agent 72.805750 81.498625 well i think one of the problem is again isn't really the centralization but uh the further removed uh you get from cause and effect
Customer 73.995000 81.245375 [silence]
Customer 81.245375 82.497625 um-hum
Agent 81.498625 84.744625 further removed cause and effect get the the uh
Customer 82.497625 91.737375 [silence]
Agent 84.744625 88.154500 more problems you have i remember an incident um
Agent 88.154500 89.180250 [noise]
Agent 89.180250 92.291500 back when i was in Dallas
Customer 91.737375 93.451625 um-hum
Agent 92.291500 93.312500 [silence]
Agent 93.312500 99.998000 where there were there was a push to to put in some regional airports and uh
Customer 93.451625 116.411875 [silence]
Agent 99.998000 101.288875 [noise]
Agent 101.288875 107.484375 i don't remember exactly what it was but one of the reason for putting these in was that
Agent 107.484375 117.499000 that they they wouldn't really have to pay for them i think they'd have to just ten percent or maybe it was twenty percent or something and they could get federal funds to do the rest
Customer 116.411875 118.491125 um-hum
Agent 117.499000 124.981625 and it seemed to me that that was a crazy reason that it basically if it was not uh beneficial enough to
Customer 118.491125 164.665000 [silence]
Agent 124.981625 138.488250 uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the Dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government
Agent 138.488250 150.782375 and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why
Agent 150.782375 151.993875 um
Agent 151.993875 153.763125 [silence]
Agent 153.763125 160.476625 centralization or federal funding is a bad idea and why it causes us to have
Agent 160.476625 164.998250 um increased tax rates and yet not much to show for it
Customer 164.665000 173.998500 um tremendous deficit anyway uh yeah i- i don't know i- i uh i rather think we're not going to see the end of the deficit for some time
Agent 164.998250 193.995625 [silence]
Customer 173.998500 188.000000 although if the entire incumbent mood holds up we may there may be some changes this fall i'm not sure they're they're kind of strange because there are a lot of incumbents running as outsiders now
Customer 188.000000 194.967125 uh running against Washington so that's so we have the outsiders doing the insiders bid you know
Agent 193.995625 195.539000 hum
Customer 194.967125 201.995500 trying to get themselves reelected i was just thinking that's kind of strange i don't think they're going to
Agent 195.539000 255.970250 [silence]
Customer 201.995500 211.853875 i don't think i don't know how many of them are going to get reelected that way especially after they after all three hundred fifty two or how ever many names got published officially
Customer 211.853875 219.985250 you know we had Robert K Dornam who's been a gap fly of a lot of uh he's he's been uh
Customer 219.985250 222.995000 uh Orange County's um
Customer 222.995000 224.303875 [silence]
Customer 224.303875 235.279500 uh [laughter] i don't know i embarrassment i guess he's he's really terrible they um never voted down a a weapon's package ever
Customer 235.279500 242.765000 and uh he he went out and and uh said claimed that that [vocalized-noise] that one check that he he uh he
Customer 242.765000 256.981375 he wrote that bounced was to get a uh to get a something like a statue of a Madonna for his for [laughter-his] for his backyard or something ridiculous like that it was it was pretty funny
Agent 255.970250 270.544750 well i think it's easy to you know once you get in the position of power it's easy to just sort of relax and uh abuse that power just naturally without hardly trying
Customer 256.981375 268.960750 [silence]
Customer 268.960750 274.969750 yeah yeah i very much so um you know
Agent 270.544750 273.484250 [silence]
Agent 273.484250 278.024750 it's hard to be ethical i think
Customer 274.969750 277.255375 [silence]
Customer 277.255375 279.499375 um-hum
Agent 278.024750 280.493625 that must be why we see so many
Customer 279.499375 284.498375 [silence]
Agent 280.493625 285.491875 that i mean it's hard to be ethical when you are a powerful person is what i meant to say
Customer 284.498375 286.223125 yeah
Agent 285.491875 289.754000 that may be why we see so many corrupt officials
Customer 286.223125 288.746500 [silence]
Customer 288.746500 294.256125 do you think it's because other people because people are spending other people money they got
Agent 289.754000 293.984500 [silence]
Agent 293.984500 298.562000 uh no i just think it's because power corrupt absolute[ly]-
Customer 294.256125 298.562000 [silence]
