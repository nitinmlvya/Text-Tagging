Customer 1.640125 2.334500 okay
Customer 2.334500 4.068500 [silence]
Agent 4.023125 17.706375 [silence]
Customer 4.068500 6.381125 damned if i know um [laughter]
Customer 6.381125 17.334500 i don't uh i suspect uh let's see [noise] i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but Lord knows you sh[ouldn't]- one shouldn't say that
Customer 17.334500 18.815625 [silence]
Agent 17.706375 18.555750 well
Agent 18.555750 25.979250 [silence]
Customer 18.815625 25.895000 i- i- i suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money
Customer 25.895000 27.240125 and work from there
Agent 25.979250 28.119250 that would probably be good
Customer 27.240125 28.240125 [silence]
Agent 28.119250 28.944875 [silence]
Customer 28.240125 30.477375 because i because_1 i don't think they're very good at it
Agent 28.944875 29.579125 but
Agent 29.579125 30.567750 [silence]
Customer 30.477375 39.839500 [silence]
Agent 30.567750 31.594500 something
Agent 31.594500 34.351625 that the government hasn't been looking at
Agent 34.351625 35.614125 is
Agent 35.614125 37.469750 [silence]
Agent 37.469750 38.844375 the source of the problem
Agent 38.844375 40.572125 [silence]
Customer 39.839500 41.199625 um
Agent 40.572125 42.451500 the true source of the problem
Customer 41.199625 44.616875 [silence]
Agent 42.451500 45.108000 is A that we do spend too much
Customer 44.616875 46.055000 yes
Agent 45.108000 47.880875 but also B that we don't take in enough
Customer 46.055000 48.462250 [silence]
Agent 47.880875 53.051500 [silence]
Customer 48.462250 49.945375 yeah well
Customer 49.945375 53.172750 wh[y]- wh[y]- wh[y]- why do you say that actually
Agent 53.051500 54.005250 uh
Customer 53.172750 58.377125 [silence]
Agent 54.005250 57.766625 too few Americans are working
Agent 57.766625 59.328750 [silence]
Customer 58.377125 59.443875 hum
Agent 59.328750 62.689625 if more Americans were working and meaningful
Customer 59.443875 65.121125 [silence]
Agent 62.689625 64.848750 good paying labor
Agent 64.848750 66.252750 [silence]
Customer 65.121125 66.426125 yes
Agent 66.252750 67.676250 and paying taxes
Customer 66.426125 68.999500 [silence]
Agent 67.676250 69.446750 [silence]
Customer 68.999500 70.772750 rather than using taxed
Agent 69.446750 72.288500 and the tax structure was fair between
Customer 70.772750 82.061500 [silence]
Agent 72.288500 73.352250 the
Agent 73.352250 74.513250 [silence]
Agent 74.513250 77.340625 lowest and the highest income Americans
Agent 77.340625 78.582000 [silence]
Agent 78.582000 81.891000 then we would have more money there to play with
Agent 81.891000 92.845875 [silence]
Customer 82.061500 93.603750 oh that's interesting yeah that's probably true i mean well we also we'd be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people aren't working it's back in the system
Agent 92.845875 93.836000 right
Customer 93.603750 102.959750 so you're right that's a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise rev[enue]- i mean to raise jobs i wonder
Agent 93.836000 103.234500 [silence]
Customer 102.959750 119.089250 [silence]
Agent 103.234500 104.471750 well
Agent 104.471750 106.910750 i
Agent 106.910750 110.786250 hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves
Agent 110.786250 112.010500 to
Agent 112.010500 113.487125 [silence]
Agent 113.487125 114.875000 affluence
Agent 114.875000 116.179125 but in fact
Agent 116.179125 117.576375 [silence]
Agent 117.576375 119.716000 in some cases that's what we ought to do
Customer 119.089250 121.790375 oh okay so
Agent 119.716000 122.113250 [silence]
Customer 121.790375 123.442625 start when
Agent 122.113250 124.115125 not {Reaganomics} thank you
Customer 123.442625 125.514750 [laughter]
Agent 124.115125 128.341375 [silence]
Customer 125.514750 126.838625 [silence]
Customer 126.838625 128.948375 but that is not gonna work uh
Agent 128.341375 131.974250 uh what i was thinking more along the lines of
Customer 128.948375 135.690125 [silence]
Agent 131.974250 134.994500 is start going to space
Agent 134.994500 139.471250 [silence]
Customer 135.690125 136.876625 hum
Customer 136.876625 139.920000 and that way just create more jobs
Agent 139.471250 140.495250 well
Customer 139.920000 141.487125 or whatever
Agent 140.495250 141.719625 [silence]
Customer 141.487125 154.061375 [silence]
Agent 141.719625 144.144625 at some point there there will be
Agent 144.144625 145.493375 [silence]
Agent 145.493375 146.691375 enough
Agent 146.691375 148.556875 jobs
Agent 148.556875 150.727250 for
Agent 150.727250 154.327125 most of the ab[le]- able-bodied Americans
Customer 154.061375 158.458000 hum um-hum well that's a neat idea
Agent 154.327125 158.128375 [silence]
Agent 158.128375 160.032375 we also need to uh
Customer 158.458000 165.208875 [silence]
Agent 160.032375 161.933125 [silence]
Agent 161.933125 164.906875 assure that there's some work in the private sector
Agent 164.906875 169.051000 [silence]
Customer 165.208875 169.526875 yeah that's what that's what y[ou]- you think space would do that much for that or
Agent 169.051000 174.743500 i think it would do something for it i think we would fill up new technologies
Customer 169.526875 174.748375 [silence]
Agent 174.743500 176.772000 but i think we should also
Customer 174.748375 175.888000 hum
Customer 175.888000 179.411625 [silence]
Agent 176.772000 179.394750 do something rather radical
Agent 179.394750 180.705000 [silence]
Customer 179.411625 180.345875 like what
Customer 180.345875 182.840250 [silence]
Agent 180.705000 182.048625 legalize marijuana
Agent 182.048625 188.324500 [silence]
Customer 182.840250 188.732375 oh you think you think that would uh have a major effect well that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway
Agent 188.324500 189.093750 what
Customer 188.732375 193.645500 th[at]- that might have a um a good effect on on on crime anyway
Agent 189.093750 193.726125 [silence]
Customer 193.645500 207.404000 [silence]
Agent 193.726125 197.099500 yes uh okay i think it would
Agent 197.099500 198.994125 take some of that money
Agent 198.994125 202.349875 out of the hands of criminals i think it would put
Agent 202.349875 208.002250 reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another
Customer 207.404000 209.424375 that's probably true
Agent 208.002250 209.855625 [silence]
Customer 209.424375 218.072375 [silence]
Agent 209.855625 211.469250 i think that
Agent 211.469250 213.413250 i think most importantly
Agent 213.413250 214.902875 [silence]
Agent 214.902875 218.385250 it would give the federal government something new that they could tax
Customer 218.072375 221.520625 [laughter] and probably a lot of
Agent 218.385250 221.569000 [silence]
Customer 221.520625 224.617875 [silence]
Agent 221.569000 225.010000 and probably a lot of and really receive some revenues from
Customer 224.617875 226.927625 yeah but that's potentially you know
Agent 225.010000 225.973625 [silence]
Agent 225.973625 227.282500 uh if you
Customer 226.927625 236.530500 [silence]
Agent 227.282500 229.202125 look at prohibition
Agent 229.202125 230.702875 historically
Agent 230.702875 232.943125 [silence]
Agent 232.943125 234.145375 it's repeal
Agent 234.145375 236.431500 helped the federal government a lot
Agent 236.431500 238.407250 in tax revenues
Customer 236.530500 239.248250 um-hum um
Agent 238.407250 244.267500 [silence]
Customer 239.248250 240.607125 [silence]
Customer 240.607125 243.469125 no i'd never thought about that
Customer 243.469125 253.960250 [silence]
Agent 244.267500 247.611250 then i think once we put
Agent 247.611250 249.818500 [silence]
Agent 249.818500 253.768750 money back into the coff[ers]- in the coffers of the federal government
Agent 253.768750 256.854875 [silence]
Customer 253.960250 255.632875 um-hum
Customer 255.632875 290.352625 [silence]
Agent 256.854875 258.790625 and get the federal government
Agent 258.790625 260.332750 [silence]
Agent 260.332750 261.668375 t[o]- where
Agent 261.668375 263.747500 there's money there again
Agent 263.747500 265.327250 [silence]
Agent 265.327250 266.994125 we should reduce
Agent 266.994125 269.034750 [silence]
Agent 269.034750 271.786625 the amount of money
Agent 271.786625 273.853375 and this would have to come rather quickly
Agent 273.853375 275.657250 [silence]
Agent 275.657250 278.186250 and would have to c[ome]- come originally also
Agent 278.186250 279.158375 [silence]
Agent 279.158375 281.206750 where we're not paying
Agent 281.206750 284.938500 in some cases we do pay more for
Agent 284.938500 288.989250 welfare recipients to live then they can earn
Agent 288.989250 290.733625 [silence]
Customer 290.352625 291.448250 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 290.733625 293.166375 in the true minimum wage
Customer 291.448250 293.779000 [silence]
Agent 293.166375 294.369750 environment
Customer 293.779000 297.472250 that's true we do often times they are paid more yeah
Agent 294.369750 298.812125 [silence]
Customer 297.472250 309.887250 [silence]
Agent 298.812125 299.602875 and
Agent 299.602875 300.959500 you can't
Agent 300.959500 303.001125 [silence]
Agent 303.001125 305.211750 deny people the right
Agent 305.211750 307.068125 to supply
Agent 307.068125 310.236750 their families better through whatever means
Customer 309.887250 310.965250 right
Agent 310.236750 312.345875 that's just sensible on their part
Customer 310.965250 312.677375 [silence]
Agent 312.345875 314.149250 [silence]
Customer 312.677375 315.010250 that's just what on their part i'm sorry i missed that
Agent 314.149250 317.441375 it's just sensible on their parts to go after the
Customer 315.010250 316.130250 oh
Customer 316.130250 319.120000 [silence]
Agent 317.441375 319.316250 the the greater amount of income
Customer 319.120000 320.164875 um-hum
Agent 319.316250 320.570625 [silence]
Customer 320.164875 337.652000 [silence]
Agent 320.570625 322.005000 so if you
Agent 322.005000 324.790125 lower the amount they make and
Agent 324.790125 332.374000 raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage
Agent 332.374000 334.335750 [silence]
Agent 334.335750 335.043375 then
Agent 335.043375 337.531000 more people will get off welfare
Agent 337.531000 341.246125 [silence]
Customer 337.652000 340.804125 that that maybe true that's very true
Customer 340.804125 344.467000 [silence]
Agent 341.246125 344.662250 you know give them a true incentive to want to work
Customer 344.467000 346.151000 right
Agent 344.662250 345.941625 [silence]
Agent 345.941625 346.616000 and then
Customer 346.151000 358.840625 [silence]
Agent 346.616000 347.469500 don't
Agent 347.469500 348.817750 start
Agent 348.817750 351.143250 letting more
Agent 351.143250 352.672375 [silence]
Agent 352.672375 354.273750 outsiders in
Agent 354.273750 358.731000 for a few years -[un]til we figure exactly where we're at with unemployment
Agent 358.731000 360.401625 [silence]
Customer 358.840625 360.423750 right that's uh
Agent 360.401625 361.657500 reduce
Customer 360.423750 363.291500 [silence]
Agent 361.657500 362.938375 immigration
Agent 362.938375 364.257750 [silence]
Customer 363.291500 364.191500 um-hum
Customer 364.191500 367.893250 [silence]
Agent 364.257750 368.091750 or eliminate it entirely for a few years until we get our own house in order
Customer 367.893250 373.429125 yeah and maybe even reduce al[ong]- along the same lines maybe reduce imports as well i think
Agent 368.091750 373.577125 [silence]
Customer 373.429125 376.294375 [silence]
Agent 373.577125 375.976500 oh absolutely absolutely
Agent 375.976500 379.583000 [silence]
Customer 376.294375 379.952750 i mean we don't need to buy other people's stuff right now
Agent 379.583000 382.364500 that's right when we're in a world of hurt
Customer 379.952750 381.246500 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 381.246500 393.672625 [silence]
Agent 382.364500 383.823750 [silence]
Agent 383.823750 386.685625 well i don't i'm not going to say
Agent 386.685625 389.147125 that we ought to re[duce]-
Agent 389.147125 393.922750 reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely
Customer 393.672625 404.963000 right well that that's what happened in other country though and other places they tax us quite h[eavily]- i mean they tax American imports quite heavily so we could do the same thing i mean just and you know they may get
Agent 393.922750 403.979875 [silence]
Agent 403.979875 405.391375 it seems only fair
Customer 404.963000 407.852875 right it does seem only fair i mean why not
Agent 405.391375 407.927250 [silence]
Customer 407.852875 434.552625 [silence]
Agent 407.927250 414.974875 and i think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force
Agent 414.974875 419.878500 [silence]
Agent 419.878500 421.264750 reduced
Agent 421.264750 424.650250 [silence]
Agent 424.650250 431.482250 the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force
Agent 431.482250 433.294500 [silence]
Agent 433.294500 434.756500 there would be plenty of money
Customer 434.552625 436.304500 i- i think so
Agent 434.756500 436.445750 [silence]
Customer 436.304500 438.026000 [silence]
Agent 436.445750 438.224625 and then at that point
Customer 438.026000 438.921000 yes
Agent 438.224625 440.324875 quit spending on space
Customer 438.921000 440.390875 [silence]
Agent 440.324875 443.176000 force it all into the into the private sector
Customer 440.390875 441.420625 oh really
Customer 441.420625 442.906375 [silence]
Customer 442.906375 445.277125 oh really i love the switch
Agent 443.176000 448.999375 [silence]
Customer 445.277125 449.813875 well at that point you might we i[t]- i[t]- it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly you know we would be
Agent 448.999375 450.068875 that's right
Customer 449.813875 454.240375 we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do
