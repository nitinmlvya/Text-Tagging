Agent 115.663875 123.454750 and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month
Agent 123.454750 124.633625 [silence]

Agent 135.729875 140.138375 eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college and

Customer 156.285000 157.847750 i don't
Agent 156.910625 169.221125 but i think they're too readily accessible and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them_1 to you and get you dra[ft]- get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle when
Customer 157.847750 159.049875 [silence]
Customer 159.049875 160.545750 um-hum
Customer 160.545750 178.375375 [silence]

Agent 172.971375 181.189125 we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so
Customer 178.375375 179.865125 right
Customer 179.865125 186.694750 [silence]
Agent 181.189125 187.419375 and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need

Agent 193.583000 194.670000 yeah
Agent 194.670000 196.029125 [silence]
Agent 196.029125 209.000000 i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have
Customer 196.573750 208.313000 [silence]
Customer 208.313000 209.738375 um-hum
Agent 209.000000 215.256250 course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so i guess they'd trade one for the other
