Customer 0.000000 9.497500 [noise] i got a budget that i worked out on a spreadsheet that i keep on my home computer the only thing is that i kind of drifted away from it originally when i set it up
Agent 0.990875 16.988250 [silence]
Customer 9.497500 19.477250 um i'd started back to school and had all these grand plans and sat down and figured out everything to the penny all the way down to haircuts every little thing i could imagine spending money on
Agent 16.988250 18.994750 [laughter]
Agent 18.994750 33.980750 [silence]
Customer 19.477250 32.766250 and got it all set up and then kind of got it tuned to it and for about a year or so i kept real good track of bills and made sure things fit into it but i got to the point where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just knew what they were
Customer 32.766250 35.188375 i don't think i've looked at that thing in a year and a half
Agent 33.980750 36.371125 [laughter]
Customer 35.188375 52.265875 [silence]
Agent 36.371125 44.730250 uh i wish i could say that we did the same in terms of our family uh it we have considered it from time to time
Agent 44.730250 52.999125 and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it
Customer 52.265875 53.742875 um
Agent 52.999125 62.230500 because_1 to me the need for a budget is especially when money's tight and i'm happy to say that money's not too tight we just kind of drift along
Customer 53.742875 61.748250 [silence]
Customer 61.748250 63.025250 yeah
Agent 62.230500 72.718250 uh we've gotten into troubles recently while the last couple of years we're all of a sudden uh it's IRS time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money

Customer 72.493875 77.491375 [silence]
Agent 72.718250 77.783000 but we've even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head
Customer 77.491375 89.683750 yeah keeping it keeping all the records and all that stuff is a pretty high maintenance thing takes some dedication to really sit down and do it but it definitely does pay off if you keep track of things keep a good grip on it
Agent 77.783000 88.982500 [silence]
Agent 88.982500 90.995250 how does it pay off for you

Agent 90.995250 109.013875 [silence]
Customer 95.498125 103.495250 uh fri[volous]- frivolous waste too much uh going out things like that that really i can do without those kind of things
Customer 103.495250 109.494500 it's hard to um to just go out and keep a day to day balance of stuff
Agent 109.013875 110.730000 right
Customer 109.494500 122.310125 reminds me years ago i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them_1 all and tape them_1 on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails you're biting off you'll be amazed

Agent 136.464875 148.997875 and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness i'm not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think i'm ready to elect you to Congress uh
Customer 139.493625 152.473000 [silence]
Agent 148.997875 151.499500 uh in terms of actually considering a budget

Customer 176.711125 179.715750 yeah yep

Agent 188.686000 202.993375 actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like twenty eight dollars left for the month of February

Agent 226.221375 239.255500 you bet you bet i think the reason why they did it was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of berry berry or some sort of [laughter] disease like that
Customer 227.443375 232.991375 [silence]
Customer 232.991375 236.228500 [laughter]
