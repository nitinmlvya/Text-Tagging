Agent 55.956750 56.969875 [silence]
Agent 56.969875 61.091500 it it it does seems [noise] like a lot uh
Agent 61.091500 63.971750 i wish i had a better feeling for
Agent 63.971750 74.329625 uh a better breakdown rather than oh well you know X X billions of dollars go to defense and X billions of dollars go here
Agent 74.329625 83.559375 it it it's hard i i have a hard time conceiving of any larger amount of money then say uh really a couple thousand dollars every thing else is
Agent 83.559375 90.072500 is like Monopoly money it it's so larger you don't really have a personal feeling for it if you go to by a new car
Agent 90.072500 99.687250 you get a better feeling for for what's going on but even then it usually most of that is is finance through the bank and you not actually holding the money in your hands
Customer 99.105500 100.415625 um-hum
Agent 99.687250 100.972875 but uh
Customer 100.415625 109.108250 [silence]
Agent 100.972875 102.624500 i [vocalized-noise]
Agent 102.624500 104.492625 Americans in general well
Agent 104.492625 105.493625 [silence]
Agent 105.493625 118.341250 i i would like to see a little bit better return for the the social program i actually don't mind paying taxes for things like social programs helping people out
Customer 109.108250 110.133875 [noise]
Customer 110.133875 134.114750 [silence]
Agent 118.341250 125.937750 because my basic philosophy is that that most people are out to mess with the system most people actually
Agent 125.937750 134.634375 generally want to work or want to to make themselves better and they are not lazy i don't believe that everybody is out there to rip of the system
Customer 134.114750 135.427125 um-hum
Agent 134.634375 141.143500 but there is a hold lot of bureaucracy and so many places for the money to fall through the cracks that
Customer 135.427125 161.078250 [silence]
Agent 141.143500 146.034750 after a while it becomes to easy an[d]- an[d]- and people uh
Agent 146.034750 155.287500 say well oh sure well we we haven't plan ahead so we could spend twice as much as as what we really need that's okay we will just let it go and
Agent 155.287500 161.506375 and then it comes down to the crunch and crisis management and oh well just spend another few thousands dollars an[d]-
Customer 161.078250 162.248625 hum
Agent 161.506375 174.408125 so there there's no good handle on it no one i guess feels really responsible in those situation and all that money adds up and you have enormous cost in the government and people get angry and upset
Customer 162.248625 173.874750 [silence]
Customer 173.874750 175.030250 hum
Agent 174.408125 196.091375 [noise]
Customer 175.030250 181.522875 that's interesting but uh i guess that's uh something that happen when there is so many people involved
Customer 181.522875 185.140125 each one fill like they [vocalized-noise]
Customer 185.140125 187.431875 take a responsibility for

Customer 189.689000 193.141500 making sure that thing work the way there suppose to or something
Customer 193.141500 196.870750 but um i never really thought of it that way but
Agent 196.091375 196.957250 huh
Customer 196.870750 200.969125 i guess there [vocalized-noise] seems like their some programs that are more valuable
Agent 196.957250 210.056500 [silence]
Customer 200.969125 203.627625 and other that be [vocalized-noise]
Customer 203.627625 205.901750 that be useful to have more uh
Customer 205.901750 209.641125 sort of tax payer involvement in some of that decision making
Customer 209.641125 210.811500 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 210.056500 219.859375 oh sure yeah i know i agree with you on that what sort of a involvement with with something like maybe oh a defenses a little hard but
Customer 210.811500 226.544750 [silence]
Agent 219.859375 222.820625 but what sort of involvement uh
Agent 222.820625 228.084250 would we be able to do what type of oversight would you like to see on that
Customer 226.544750 228.164750 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 228.084250 261.877875 [silence]
Customer 228.164750 229.105500 um
Customer 229.105500 230.509000 [silence]
Customer 230.509000 236.755250 i know maybe just in the point of you know having focus group with uh or elected representative will be one
Customer 236.755250 238.934500 solutions where they actually
Customer 238.934500 244.155125 maybe they do have more in some area of the country then then where i'm from but it's
Customer 244.155125 246.615500 i think it's rare to actually no
Customer 246.615500 247.617500 [silence]
Customer 247.617500 258.548625 like you can influence what uh your representative is really doing because_1 if you know if even if there's even a lot of writing campaign chances are there'll be a lot of letters on both sides of the issue
Customer 258.548625 262.802500 particularly if if it is a controversial bill or something like that
Agent 261.877875 263.537250 huh yeah
Customer 262.802500 284.993250 [silence]

Agent 275.235875 279.383625 are are angry about their taxes being so high
Agent 279.383625 285.402125 and the ideal of the higher taxes is help us to pay off the high deficit in the state
Customer 284.993250 286.269250 um-hum
Agent 285.402125 295.095375 and many people fall back on well there's money there's a lot of money being misspent its all there we do have to do anything except well it's all out there somewhere
