Agent 0.000000 35.872625 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 3.008375 [noise] well i definitely think taxes are too high
Customer 3.008375 11.194000 uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's uh income now
Customer 11.194000 21.245625 and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes
Customer 21.245625 29.825750 but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridi[culous]- you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes
Customer 29.825750 35.719250 uh and it's so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing
Customer 35.719250 51.763375 [silence]
Agent 35.872625 43.258125 well let's see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh
Agent 43.258125 48.761250 yeah maybe in some cases they're not high enough for instance uh
Agent 48.761250 51.704250 here in my state uh
Agent 51.704250 54.259125 [silence]
Customer 51.763375 55.141625 you have a real high sales tax there if i recall
Agent 54.259125 60.032875 yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax
Customer 55.141625 59.527625 [silence]
Customer 59.527625 60.173625 uh-huh
Agent 60.032875 72.245750 and uh you know we don't have an income tax because uh basically no[body]- nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here
Customer 60.173625 72.115000 [silence]
Customer 72.115000 73.477625 oh really
Agent 72.245750 83.847875 yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of Washington per uh per student
Customer 73.477625 75.523625 [silence]
Customer 75.523625 77.492500 <b_aside> get out of my room <e_aside>
Customer 77.492500 91.654750 [silence]
Agent 83.847875 92.254000 is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it we're we're ranked fairly low
Customer 91.654750 93.070125 interesting
Agent 92.254000 102.269500 uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know we've got here in the Seattle area we've got a lot of uh
Customer 93.070125 107.454375 [silence]
Agent 102.269500 108.286625 uh high technology industries we've got Microsoft here well Microsoft expects well educated employees
Customer 107.454375 108.815000 sure
Agent 108.286625 113.327750 but uh you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh
Customer 108.815000 131.784625 [silence]
Agent 113.327750 122.501875 towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there there's
Agent 122.501875 127.947500 you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh
Agent 127.947500 133.049500 uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well
Customer 131.784625 141.678125 my my feeling about at least i I don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here
Agent 133.049500 175.378875 [silence]
Customer 141.678125 146.103000 uh some of the public schools get more funds than
Customer 146.103000 157.064125 the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student
Customer 157.064125 159.413000 but the best private school
Customer 159.413000 172.355375 is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money
Customer 172.355375 177.665750 just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and
Agent 175.378875 186.136125 well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff
Customer 177.665750 180.828875 [silence]
Customer 180.828875 181.835125 [laughter]
Customer 181.835125 186.132250 [silence]
Customer 186.132250 194.105875 yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um
Agent 186.136125 229.305750 [silence]
Customer 194.105875 198.365375 uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which
Customer 198.365375 209.315500 all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction
Customer 209.315500 216.191375 meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up
Customer 216.191375 223.326750 uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools
Customer 223.326750 231.759000 went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh
Agent 229.305750 240.065000 yeah that's i've i've been hearing that that's uh that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh what all the reasons are for that
Customer 231.759000 239.294750 [silence]
Customer 239.294750 244.362750 yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh
Agent 240.065000 298.786000 [silence]
Customer 244.362750 253.445500 on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending
Customer 253.445500 261.447250 a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia uh we have no business spending that money
Customer 261.447250 270.272625 and uh we're spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a Presidential candidate forum here
Customer 270.272625 276.296000 last Saturday and ju[st]- we just had our primary in Georgia and uh
Customer 276.296000 285.246875 uh you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was uh
Customer 285.246875 290.275875 and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year
Customer 290.275875 298.786000 what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he ta[lked]- and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabi[net]-
