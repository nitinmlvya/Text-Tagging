Agent 23.379000 32.434500 uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial [laughter-situation]

Customer 33.179375 57.245750 [silence]
Agent 44.907375 57.854500 and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did
Customer 57.245750 61.646875 oh well we don't have a real strict budget um
Agent 57.854500 69.014000 [silence]

Agent 69.014000 70.989625 sure uh-huh
Agent 70.989625 84.647375 [silence]
Customer 72.421375 85.471000 i- i don't know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there
Agent 84.647375 86.445500 um-hum [noise]
Customer 85.471000 87.199125 a certain amount
Agent 86.445500 92.891375 i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh
Customer 87.199125 88.695125 [silence]
Customer 88.695125 90.293375 yeah
Customer 90.293375 98.653375 [silence]
Agent 92.891375 106.832250 you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i- i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there
Customer 98.653375 100.280875 oh
Customer 100.280875 110.007500 [silence]

Agent 111.283250 118.008625 [noise] yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff
Customer 112.375750 123.144000 [silence]
Agent 118.008625 127.292875 and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own per[sonal]- personal storage
Customer 123.144000 125.163000 oh
Customer 125.163000 128.994625 oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient [laughter]
Agent 127.292875 141.289000 [laughter] well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall wh[en]- if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up
Customer 128.994625 141.463375 [silence]
Agent 141.289000 147.962250 so it's it's worked very well that way at least that way we [noise] you know if each of us finds something is missing
Customer 141.463375 143.000000 hm
Customer 143.000000 151.248625 [silence]

Agent 151.671750 155.815750 that way we can keep up to date [noise]
Customer 153.595250 155.633750 [silence]
Customer 155.633750 160.513250 let's see the the other thing there the topic was talking about was
Agent 155.815750 179.435500 [silence]
Customer 160.513250 169.397625 if you if i don't all i can think of is if you don't keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses but um
Customer 169.397625 180.418000 [noise] one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas well not fly back but somehow we get back there
Agent 179.435500 180.912250 uh-huh
Customer 180.418000 186.639000 and um this year we did it by train because_1 it was the least expensive and [noise]
Agent 180.912250 185.214500 [silence]
Agent 185.214500 189.715875 well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time [noise]
Customer 186.639000 188.885500 huh oh yeah
Customer 188.885500 194.306750 and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare
Agent 189.715875 192.712875 [silence]
Agent 192.712875 193.958375 yeah
Agent 193.958375 210.461250 [silence]
Customer 194.306750 196.143375 and so um
Customer 196.143375 203.604500 [noise] we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and
Customer 203.604500 206.214625 entertainment things like that then um
Customer 206.214625 212.459500 somewhere in out in the wash it'll come out that we have enough to get back there you know
Agent 210.461250 217.187375 sure well i think we unconsciously [noise] do the same thing excuse me my throat's not as clear today as it should be
Customer 212.459500 216.109250 [silence]
Customer 216.109250 217.900000 uh-huh that's right
Agent 217.187375 225.723125 uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks
Customer 217.900000 224.239625 [silence]
Customer 224.239625 225.702625 uh-huh
Customer 225.702625 244.138875 [silence]
Agent 225.723125 230.596375 tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money
Agent 230.596375 241.350500 so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip
Agent 241.350500 244.655625 so th[at]- that is another way of uh budgeting
Customer 244.138875 245.928250 uh-huh that's right
Agent 244.655625 255.273125 and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we don't throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice
Customer 245.928250 254.604125 [silence]
Customer 254.604125 264.538250 yeah well whenever [laughter] i don't know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will i'll probably pick it up [laughter]

Agent 279.921625 287.790375 it is important to to have a budget [noise] and uh i- i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the
Agent 287.790375 292.583500 level of my ch[ecking]- checking account and i have a money market account also
Customer 291.896500 293.452750 uh-huh
