Agent 128.013500 141.162250 that's right i've seen that happen and it's it what's even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations
Customer 130.074125 147.481500 [silence]
Agent 141.162250 150.714875 [noise] is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because we're the smart guys and without us society can't function and that that's no license to steal
Customer 147.481500 149.447250 um-hum

Agent 174.595750 184.474250 [silence]
Agent 184.474250 195.756375 right and it it's not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldn't survive
