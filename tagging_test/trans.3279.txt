Customer 20.393875 34.326625 uh you you've seen that which was on there and the offices and in light of these uh hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed

Agent 33.527250 35.165500 right
Customer 34.326625 42.825375 they really don't [laughter-have] enough to keep them_1 busy and keep their noses at in their own business and what they're doing and the other thing is uh

Agent 40.854375 53.956000 [silence]

Agent 55.741750 72.409875 [silence]

Agent 72.409875 74.044750 yeah
Customer 73.724500 91.451500 [silence]
Agent 74.044750 87.873000 well i one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes and the um
Agent 87.873000 97.551250 [noise] regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of of our personal income and then [noise] the uh corporate

Customer 128.863375 135.527000 i really think the biggest problem and then the Taft Rudman Act is supposed to help that the biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing

Agent 197.273250 207.480750 [silence]
