Agent 0.000000 0.521750 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.355500 [noise]
Customer 0.355500 11.967500 something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didn't uh get too much built up on it that we didn't know it was out there but
Agent 0.521750 30.444375 [silence]
Customer 11.967500 20.625125 we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable
Customer 20.625125 29.826375 uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off
Customer 29.826375 31.473250 uh
Agent 30.444375 37.445125 which [noise] which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card
Customer 31.473250 36.828500 [silence]
Customer 36.828500 37.942750 right
Agent 37.445125 64.015375 [silence]
Customer 37.942750 50.427250 yeah it's it's strange that that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine
Customer 50.427250 60.406750 i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because
Customer 60.406750 64.550125 that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent
Agent 64.015375 73.512625 yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have
Customer 64.550125 76.068375 [silence]
Agent 73.512625 76.648375 you know eighteen percent some of them_1 even higher
Customer 76.068375 77.202500 right
Agent 76.648375 82.416875 and uh uh you know it it's some of them are almost uh usurious
Customer 77.202500 83.060875 [silence]
Agent 82.416875 83.718375 so
Customer 83.060875 93.308250 the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of y[our]- all your purchases back
Agent 83.718375 111.314375 [silence]
Customer 93.308250 105.769375 but they had a uh a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee
Customer 105.769375 107.788125 if you use it at a uh
Customer 107.788125 119.648750 a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so [laughter-that] would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh
Agent 111.314375 112.577125 right
Agent 112.577125 129.771000 [silence]
Customer 119.648750 130.052375 that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i- i hardly i never have that i know of
Agent 129.771000 132.514250 yeah it's like my uh ATM card
Customer 130.052375 139.961125 [silence]
Agent 132.514250 146.496750 [noise] if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and it's down in the lobby i've got a these automatic teller machines then it's very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there
Customer 139.961125 141.059625 um-hum
Customer 141.059625 155.883625 [silence]
Agent 146.496750 155.892875 but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars
Customer 155.883625 156.971750 yep
Agent 155.892875 159.065125 for that transaction which i thought gosh
Customer 156.971750 158.380000 [silence]
Customer 158.380000 164.642375 and if you happen [vocalized-noise] to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh
Agent 159.065125 162.068750 [silence]
Agent 162.068750 163.318625 yeah
Agent 163.318625 164.707625 yeah
Customer 164.642375 176.966625 the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's there's several opportunities to use the uh
Agent 164.707625 201.561625 [silence]
Customer 176.966625 191.554500 card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around
Customer 191.554500 202.078625 and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them_1
Agent 201.561625 202.743750 yeah
Customer 202.078625 206.226500 [silence]
Agent 202.743750 206.681250 [noise] do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash
Customer 206.226500 212.560000 i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i- i guess i
Agent 206.681250 224.320125 [silence]
Customer 212.560000 224.477625 i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had
Agent 224.320125 229.511750 yeah th[at's]- well that's that's not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that
Customer 224.477625 239.873750 [silence]
Agent 229.511750 240.269625 when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me
Customer 239.873750 240.832875 hum
Agent 240.269625 241.724250 and uh
Customer 240.832875 263.824000 [silence]
Agent 241.724250 243.179000 uh
Agent 243.179000 252.064875 you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money [laughter-before] it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card
Agent 252.064875 264.354750 uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been uh quite so expensive
Customer 263.824000 265.175875 yeah
Agent 264.354750 298.786000 [silence]
Customer 265.175875 267.354375 i guess that's the way they
Customer 267.354375 273.237750 planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to uh
Customer 273.237750 275.468375 i do seem to recall
Customer 275.468375 277.020875 uh
Customer 277.020875 282.160000 oh i- i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh
Customer 282.160000 292.512750 gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other pla[ces]- places were closed it was after hours as it were and
Customer 292.512750 298.786000 there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open
