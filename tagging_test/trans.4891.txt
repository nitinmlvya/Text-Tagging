Agent 37.536500 43.556875 um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and can't spend and
Agent 43.556875 52.189750 you know so i[t]- it's not like we just totally don't have a clue as to what's going [laughter-on] but i wish we were a little more organized a little more
Customer 51.837125 56.793250 you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about
Agent 52.189750 54.337000 faithful to a budget
Agent 54.337000 64.749375 [silence]
Customer 56.793250 67.266500 but we don't have a budget where it says its so much for this and so much for that but we do put a certain amount in checking account each month which we should pay for the mortgage and the electric bill and all that
Agent 64.749375 66.415500 right
Agent 66.415500 75.414125 [silence]

Agent 75.414125 76.867375 [laughter]
Agent 76.867375 78.320750 right
Customer 77.526750 84.695000 and i know that i don't go above that and i know that when we empty out the mortgage and the electric bill money and all that that you know
Agent 78.320750 85.961750 [silence]
Customer 84.695000 93.706750 you got to stop [laughter-spending] but you know i- i don't know if i can say i guess with the grocery and pocket money i do have a particular number but
Agent 85.961750 89.031500 that's right that's right
Agent 89.031500 97.529000 [silence]
Customer 93.706750 99.034375 you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if something's going to break and you're gonna need more
Agent 97.529000 108.925500 that's right well it's very difficult my husband is i[n]- is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions
Customer 99.034375 116.381750 [silence]
Agent 108.925500 119.432625 it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't know what he's going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there
Customer 116.381750 117.780375 right
Customer 117.780375 148.092500 [silence]
Agent 119.432625 133.308500 but there's months that he brings home uh you know three times that much and there's some months he doesn't bring home anything it just depends on where the commissions fall and so you kind of have to you know i ha[ve]- in in my mind i know the basics i know what we've got to meet each month
Agent 133.308500 138.802000 you know and and my salary helps towards that because mine's set you know but um
Agent 138.802000 148.749250 i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that we'd like to do if i did follow a [noise] you know pencil and paper budget but
Customer 148.092500 150.310125 do you folks get to save

Agent 181.466375 192.756125 [silence]
Customer 188.698875 198.554625 i think it's the rare person who says well i'm just putting money away for my kids and and every week puts in fifty dollars or something i don['t]- i think people aren't having much left at all nowadays
Agent 192.756125 194.362875 right
Agent 194.362875 197.873000 [silence]

Agent 258.979875 266.612625 and and i'm glad he has that i'm glad he enjoys it but i used to resent it because i felt like all of our spare money went to his golf [noise]
Agent 266.612625 272.686750 i don't particularly have anything i like to do from week to week or day to day or or anything like that and that's fine
Agent 272.686750 280.768875 um and so what i started doing and he's never said you know if i wanted something i'd look in the checkbook because i'm to practical and say nah i'd better not spend the money
Customer 280.288375 281.631875 uh-huh
Agent 280.768875 285.248625 well he's never held me back you know he's always said if you want something go get it
Customer 281.631875 296.154000 [silence]
Agent 285.248625 296.316375 but i didn't feel comfortable so now when he goes and golfs i take you know if he takes out ten bucks or fifteen bucks or twenty bucks i take the same amount and i stick it in a savings account that i have at the credit union at work
