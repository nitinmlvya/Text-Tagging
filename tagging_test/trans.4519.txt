Customer 3.623500 24.141625 [silence]
Agent 9.325125 17.777875 and really i[t]- i[t]- we were really forced into keeping a budget because i'm i'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh
Agent 17.777875 22.983875 uh restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid
Agent 22.983875 25.459375 uh how about_1 yourself

Customer 48.094000 50.527750 uh frugal
Customer 50.527750 63.581375 that um we really don't need a budget you know we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing
Agent 62.533000 68.853750 yeah well i guess that really is sort of of keeping a budget you know you stay within your uh
Customer 63.581375 67.937250 [silence]
Customer 67.937250 74.965125 well we stay within our means but we don't do it uh by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically
Agent 68.853750 70.896875 within your means
Agent 70.896875 74.271625 [silence]
Agent 74.271625 75.766875 yeah
Customer 74.965125 84.399125 although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um i would say rather pathological [laughter]
Agent 75.766875 83.704250 [silence]
Agent 83.704250 85.505875 yes
Customer 84.399125 93.255250 uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than um

Agent 100.438250 105.479125 oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco that is a huge difference
Customer 104.642125 117.394625 uh that presents um a real shock [laughter] actu[ally]- actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California but
Agent 105.479125 111.115375 [silence]
Agent 111.115375 112.833875 yeah
Agent 112.833875 116.815375 [silence]

Customer 120.007625 127.503375 yeah it's God's country uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it [laughter]
Agent 121.593000 123.716500 yeah
Agent 123.716500 126.047375 [silence]
Agent 126.047375 129.435375 [laughter]
Customer 127.503375 134.819375 um so budget is not a problem for us
Agent 129.435375 160.856750 [silence]
Customer 134.819375 144.209875 uh least it hasn't been it may it may be at this point but uh up until this point it really hasn't been when i uh was in uh
Customer 144.209875 157.185750 undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly [saly/salary] salary for engineers that [vocalized-noise] in my discipline was like
Customer 157.185750 165.665750 oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that and uh i noted at that point that i was
Agent 160.856750 162.638375 um-hum
Agent 162.638375 179.644500 [silence]
Customer 165.665750 177.910000 you know if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so
Customer 177.910000 183.523625 i stopped worrying about money and uh never have worried about money since then
Agent 179.644500 181.214125 yeah
Agent 181.214125 183.682750 [silence]

Agent 183.682750 186.544375 well that's that's a system too
Agent 186.544375 201.234375 [silence]
Customer 186.815375 201.806125 sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should but uh i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but
Agent 201.234375 210.710750 well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips and you do obviously have enough to live on so i guess you're indirectly budgeting
Customer 201.806125 209.782875 [silence]
Customer 209.782875 212.054125 um-hum
Agent 210.710750 219.069500 uh just by by the fact you said that you're both very frugal uh in spending the money so i mean that's that's a form of budgeting i would think
Customer 212.054125 230.858875 [silence]
Agent 219.069500 221.977125 [silence]
Agent 221.977125 231.132250 it's kind of a kind of a strange topic to to [laughter-try] [laughter-to] for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
Customer 230.858875 237.001750 well i guess we're both lucky in that regard then
Agent 231.132250 235.533250 [silence]
