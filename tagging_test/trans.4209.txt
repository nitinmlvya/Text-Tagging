Customer 129.644750 144.045500 the they they call it the robin hood pl[an]- plan taking from the from the mostly prosperous urban district or suburb district and passing it alone to the rural districts so i don't know that that's going to be in the courts for a long time
Agent 130.575000 131.872125 [silence]
Agent 131.872125 133.219250 [laughter]
Agent 133.219250 143.434500 [silence]
Agent 143.434500 148.842125 i would think so uh that sort of thing has been tried here and
Customer 144.045500 158.567000 [silence]
Agent 148.842125 160.682125 the results are results the results were not too hardening uh and the belief here is uh kind of education what do we need that for [laughter]
Customer 158.567000 173.475125 huh well that that's about the attitude here is just that you know if if you're paying for your local tax you're paying your local school district you can see some results of it but it's if you stop and think that some of that money is going to go get shipped off to South Texas or something
Agent 160.682125 172.146125 [silence]
Agent 172.146125 173.285625 yeah
Agent 173.285625 177.720625 [silence]
Customer 173.475125 178.266125 you it its almost like i don't know socialism or something isn't it
Agent 177.720625 191.744750 exactly uh and i would think base upon my experience you have to have some of that uh consider uh some of these places in Idaho that have a school district of a total of about two hundred or three hundred children
Customer 178.266125 191.318750 [silence]
Customer 191.318750 192.505625 yeah
Agent 191.744750 204.285250 and there a certain amount of overhead in running a school district uh for instance those kids may be spread out uh over an area where driving the buses you may go forty or fifty or even sixty miles
Customer 192.505625 238.802250 [silence]
Agent 204.285250 205.848625 and
Agent 205.848625 220.678000 can you really expect the uh the people in that district to support all that overhead of getting the kids to and from school so some of the money come through the states from all people in the state basically e[qual]- well base upon their income
Agent 220.678000 227.018625 to i'm sorry i- i take i that back a little bit of it comes from their income uh
Agent 227.018625 239.092875 to support doing thing like that and that's probably okay uh it's kind of like telephone where uh the folk that live in the middle of town subsidize for people that have lines that go out for four or five miles
Customer 238.802250 239.638875 uh-huh
Agent 239.092875 247.841500 uh the other thing that we have is a property tax and that tend to subsidies part of it also
Customer 239.638875 252.951750 [silence]
Agent 247.841500 259.260750 uh the disadvantage there of course the people get into is they say hey i don't have any kids in school i've been retried for thirty five years and i'm still paying for somebody education
Customer 252.951750 255.131625 i know huh
Customer 255.131625 256.489500 huh
Customer 256.489500 258.442375 [silence]
Customer 258.442375 259.469125 yeah
Agent 259.260750 270.390125 i- i guess i'm a believe in yes you have to you have to have some overhead just like uh i never used the fire department but at the some time i'll hate to have to ante up before they got here
Customer 259.469125 266.703125 [silence]
Customer 266.703125 267.713500 [laughter]
Customer 267.713500 269.932875 [silence]

Agent 273.017000 274.485250 [silence]
Agent 274.485250 281.500875 yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect it's not quite a higher percentage as you may pay
Customer 276.055125 280.852625 [silence]
Customer 280.852625 283.946000 we don't have a state income tax yet
Agent 281.500875 284.687875 [silence]
Customer 283.946000 285.509875 [silence]
Agent 284.687875 287.049375 well [laughter]
Customer 285.509875 287.894750 huh it's coming
Agent 287.049375 289.347250 [laughter]
Customer 287.894750 291.509500 it's it's on its way i i'm almost certain
Agent 289.347250 290.526875 yeah
Agent 290.526875 291.733000 [silence]
Customer 291.509500 295.519875 uh but that's why we have that eight and a quarter percent sales tax
Agent 291.733000 293.376125 i i certainly
Agent 293.376125 295.512625 [silence]
Agent 295.512625 297.037250 that's true
