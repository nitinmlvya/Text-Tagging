Customer 0.000000 0.271375 [noise]
Customer 0.271375 3.364500 i guess my basic feeling is that
Agent 0.599375 28.862500 [silence]
Customer 3.364500 15.437000 as a middle income tax payer i'm not paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but
Customer 15.437000 25.354125 uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and
Customer 25.354125 26.368250 [silence]
Customer 26.368250 29.487125 i don't know [laughter] i'm sort of overwhelmed by it all
Agent 28.862500 32.021000 do you think that that's because the uh
Customer 29.487125 67.940125 [silence]
Agent 32.021000 36.753500 because the politicians have been seduced by the the opportunity to get the vote
Agent 36.753500 39.865750 uh so they've spent the money on
Agent 39.865750 46.850625 on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh
Agent 46.850625 49.386750 [noise] uh let's see how shall i say it
Agent 49.386750 52.026750 paying money to people that that uh
Agent 52.026750 52.978750 [noise]
Agent 52.978750 54.005875 uh
Agent 54.005875 55.485000 [silence]
Agent 55.485000 61.503625 it it takes years for a bridge to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh
Agent 61.503625 62.533875 [noise]
Agent 62.533875 65.803000 uh input of money can uh
Agent 65.803000 69.991000 which they can never turn off by the way uh will get this guy votes
Customer 67.940125 69.324500 [laughter]
Customer 69.324500 70.344375 [silence]
Agent 69.991000 111.116500 [silence]
Customer 70.344375 74.824500 yeah it's entirely possible certainly anything that's been
Customer 74.824500 85.700000 discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation
Customer 85.700000 96.186750 seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the
Customer 96.186750 102.620375 sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the
Customer 102.620375 112.377750 entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity [vocalized-noise]
Agent 111.116500 112.484500 there was
Customer 112.377750 114.180875 yeah although
Agent 112.484500 114.194750 [silence]
Customer 114.180875 115.392750 my
Agent 114.194750 115.600375 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 115.392750 116.950375 oh excuse me
Agent 115.600375 116.336875 [noise]
Agent 116.336875 119.765500 i was just going to say there's significantly more money uh
Customer 116.950375 122.509000 [silence]
Agent 119.765500 122.292875 and we weren't a debtor nation in those days
Agent 122.292875 161.486000 [silence]
Customer 122.509000 133.187750 yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family
Customer 133.187750 141.947500 today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not
Customer 141.947500 151.859250 but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs
Customer 151.859250 155.450250 for instance or public improvements and today there
Customer 155.450250 161.346375 there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding of resources by each generation
Customer 161.346375 188.915875 [silence]
Agent 161.486000 162.996375 well [vocalized-noise]
Agent 162.996375 166.085375 i think two things have happened number one
Agent 166.085375 167.108625 uh
Agent 167.108625 168.849250 it's like uh
Agent 168.849250 169.964500 [noise]
Agent 169.964500 176.866250 pay play now pay later uh somebody's we're we're to the point now where
Agent 176.866250 181.352000 [noise] where the pay later is uh is here and [noise] and uh
Agent 181.352000 182.365000 [silence]
Agent 182.365000 189.720750 when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments and
Customer 188.915875 190.376625 [laughter]
Agent 189.720750 196.197500 and it just goes by pretty fast well uh the play now pay later uh
Customer 190.376625 201.651625 [silence]
Agent 196.197500 203.378875 mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh
Customer 201.651625 202.803000 um-hum
Customer 202.803000 220.980375 [silence]
Agent 203.378875 204.921375 um
Agent 204.921375 208.602250 the the debt load is way up uh
Agent 208.602250 210.778250 you know in the sixties
Agent 210.778250 215.583375 what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in those days was
Agent 215.583375 220.712375 was the cost of uh almost monthly rent today right
Agent 220.712375 221.984375 i don['t]-
Customer 220.980375 228.898375 yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for
Agent 221.984375 235.959625 [silence]
Customer 228.898375 236.959750 tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly
Agent 235.959625 245.531875 [vocalized-noise] yeah i mean well i'm not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars but tuition uh i bet tuition was about a third of that uh
Customer 236.959750 244.463125 [silence]
Customer 244.463125 245.487000 yeah
Customer 245.487000 295.303750 [silence]
Agent 245.531875 253.610750 you know perhaps anyway what i'm saying is that everything costs more these days uh and we've reached a point where
Agent 253.610750 261.532125 where people are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing that's more important uh
Agent 261.532125 262.954875 uh
Agent 262.954875 269.271750 progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made

Agent 277.034625 285.461250 i graduated from college in sixty one and i can remember when i graduated i [vocalized-noise] hoped someday to make eighteen thousand dollars a year
Agent 285.461250 291.089500 and taxes on eighteen thousand a year uh were a whole lot less than uh
Agent 291.089500 292.124875 [silence]
Agent 292.124875 295.459875 you know taxes on wha[t]- what i thought was a very good salary
