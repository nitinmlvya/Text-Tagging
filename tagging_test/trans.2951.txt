Agent 376.444000 386.747125 [silence]

Customer 386.869750 408.802625 [silence]
Agent 391.544875 397.764000 and they will run into thousands and thousands of dollars into debt
Agent 397.764000 401.533000 and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy
Agent 401.533000 402.613250 [silence]
Agent 402.613250 409.323250 and they they have a way of uh diverting all of the things that they've bought and put it like in hiding

Agent 424.543625 429.741750 these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things
Agent 429.741750 432.047375 and then they went bankrupt

Customer 436.855250 462.970625 [silence]
Agent 437.678125 443.241125 and uh they said you know it was worth the uh jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time
Agent 443.241125 446.904875 because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off
Agent 446.904875 453.348750 you know they can only um be responsible for a certain percent and not the full uh amount that they owed
Agent 453.348750 454.601250 [silence]
Agent 454.601250 456.535375 and i don't know who um
Agent 456.535375 462.150000 determines uh the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely
Agent 462.150000 464.373375 what they are were indebted for
Customer 462.970625 465.319000 oh no right

Customer 465.319000 479.087625 [silence]
Agent 465.915500 469.484500 so it it they use it as a scam
Agent 469.484500 471.548875 instead of uh
Agent 471.548875 474.714750 to me they were criminals and they used th[at]- that
Agent 474.714750 475.917625 [silence]
