Agent 68.265750 75.997625 that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they're mismanaged and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a
Agent 75.997625 88.850375 i don't know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say i'll tax them_1 if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending
Customer 87.991375 89.985250 um-hum
Agent 88.850375 94.840250 um i don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a
Customer 89.985250 100.490125 [silence]
Agent 94.840250 106.936750 the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California
Customer 100.490125 102.490875 yeah

Agent 123.553750 130.830375 we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it
Customer 128.492000 134.461250 um-hum [noise] right do where are you at what state
Agent 130.830375 132.272750 so

Agent 140.391625 152.443125 that's true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
Customer 143.222625 150.971625 [silence]

Agent 152.443125 157.682875 know you don't sound like you're from Dallas where do you co[me]- do you come from originally Texas or
Customer 154.483500 155.970875 [silence]
Customer 155.970875 169.583750 y[eah]- yeah i do i've lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm
Agent 157.682875 161.475125 [silence]
Agent 161.475125 163.461500 oh okay
Agent 163.461500 167.994500 [silence]
Agent 167.994500 177.465875 you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
Customer 169.583750 171.243500 [silence]
Customer 171.243500 173.485375 yeah
Customer 173.485375 175.974750 [silence]
Customer 175.974750 180.153125 no no i've just lived here but
Agent 177.465875 179.954375 yeah
Agent 179.954375 193.443625 [silence]
Customer 180.153125 184.151625 i don't know i- i do i can think of all the uh
Customer 184.151625 195.742000 the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i can't think of this the scripture Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's so
Agent 193.443625 195.541000 that's right
Agent 195.541000 204.489125 [silence]
Customer 195.742000 197.537750 you know even uh
Customer 197.537750 212.246500 i think even in the the story where uh they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fish's mouth or in the fish's inside the fish
Agent 204.489125 206.644875 yeah
Agent 206.644875 216.603000 [silence]
Customer 212.246500 220.992500 and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah
Agent 216.603000 226.845500 oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the [vocalized-noise] would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would make him contradict himself
Customer 220.992500 226.218000 [silence]
Customer 226.218000 227.767875 right
Agent 226.845500 236.033500 and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you know you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's you render unto God what is God's and uh
Customer 227.767875 233.487000 [silence]
Customer 233.487000 234.977500 right
Customer 234.977500 239.890000 [silence]
Agent 236.033500 242.834750 a[nd]- you know of course there i don't think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something [laughter]
Customer 239.890000 243.481250 right get in yeah
Agent 242.834750 248.081500 but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to
Customer 243.481250 249.237125 [silence]
Agent 248.081500 262.481625 you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know so i really do
Customer 249.237125 251.972250 oh sure
Customer 251.972250 253.980500 sure
Customer 253.980500 256.318625 [silence]
Customer 256.318625 258.342500 right
Customer 258.342500 261.310750 um-hum right
Customer 261.310750 262.617750 [silence]
Agent 262.481625 268.396500 where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or
Customer 262.617750 264.749375 yeah are
Customer 264.749375 267.732250 [silence]
Customer 267.732250 277.733750 no not really i- i we've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year
Agent 268.396500 285.464625 [silence]
Customer 277.733750 291.781875 um i have been married for just a few years so i've had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular [laughter-right] all the deductions and all that
Agent 285.464625 290.478500 schedule A well yeah and you know
Agent 290.478500 299.240750 did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder [laughter]
Customer 291.781875 295.762375 [silence]
Customer 295.762375 300.494250 yeah it really did i- i saw that too
Agent 299.240750 307.490875 i didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and [laughter] other things
Customer 300.494250 303.262750 [silence]
Customer 303.262750 313.228750 right right that's we're looking at buying a house and that's one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is
Agent 307.490875 309.477375 yeah
Agent 309.477375 311.496375 [silence]
Agent 311.496375 322.784625 and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
Customer 313.228750 315.461500 yeah
Customer 315.461500 318.470875 [silence]
Customer 318.470875 320.255250 um-hum
Customer 320.255250 321.498500 [silence]
Customer 321.498500 323.486500 right
Agent 322.784625 327.260875 so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
Customer 323.486500 324.767000 [silence]
Customer 324.767000 332.553625 yeah yeah you kn[ow]- there's a a thing i just i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it
Agent 327.260875 336.973625 [silence]
Customer 332.553625 346.570125 i[f]- if you pay i- i know i get paid twice a month uh every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months
Agent 336.973625 338.522000 uh-huh
Agent 338.522000 340.768625 uh-huh
Agent 340.768625 342.734375 that's right
Agent 342.734375 352.696500 [silence]
Customer 346.570125 358.300375 so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying a
Agent 352.696500 354.482375 uh-huh
Agent 354.482375 360.481000 [silence]
Customer 358.300375 368.570500 uh one month extra every year and it'll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note
Agent 360.481000 361.992250 that's right
Agent 361.992250 365.956000 [silence]
Agent 365.956000 372.875875 that's right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago
Customer 368.570500 377.230375 [silence]
Agent 372.875875 384.358125 and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that
Customer 377.230375 379.995500 oh yeah
Customer 379.995500 381.864125 um-hum
Customer 381.864125 382.955875 [silence]
Customer 382.955875 385.598375 right yeah
Agent 384.358125 390.693375 uh just because uh exactly what you said you're making one more months payment every year
Customer 385.598375 386.993875 [silence]
Customer 386.993875 388.486875 right
Customer 388.486875 389.506625 [silence]
Customer 389.506625 397.198125 right and that's going on the principle it doesn't pay any interest or u[sually]- usually it doesn't anyway
Agent 390.693375 393.218125 [silence]
Agent 393.218125 395.766750 yeah so that's
Agent 395.766750 410.275875 that's a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner
Customer 397.198125 399.008125 yeah
Customer 399.008125 400.779750 [silence]
Customer 400.779750 403.000000 um-hum
Customer 403.000000 404.714250 um-hum
Customer 404.714250 409.283875 [silence]
Customer 409.283875 415.824625 right that's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty we're not going to go longer than twenty
Agent 410.275875 412.275375 [silence]
Agent 412.275375 414.496250 yeah
