Agent 0.000000 1.580375 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 1.836750 [noise] okay
Agent 1.580375 3.230500 all right
Customer 1.836750 46.090625 [silence]
Agent 3.230500 7.415875 uh feelings on what caused the S and L
Agent 7.415875 9.181750 crisis
Agent 9.181750 12.185000 [noise] i guess i don't
Agent 12.185000 20.697750 have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where
Agent 20.697750 24.640250 loan were made that appear to be
Agent 24.640250 32.930625 a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during
Agent 32.930625 34.948750 the Reagan eight years
Agent 34.948750 40.028000 uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
Agent 40.028000 47.081125 and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued
Customer 46.090625 49.105500 um-hum kind of like a domino's effect
Agent 47.081125 48.651875 [silence]
Agent 48.651875 53.640375 right i- i don't have a a field for whether or not
Customer 49.105500 58.133625 [silence]
Agent 53.640375 58.356125 this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome
Customer 58.133625 59.820125 no
Agent 58.356125 62.424750 uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever
Customer 59.820125 63.032750 no no
Agent 62.424750 72.329125 uh i vaguely recall but i've never gone and and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years
Customer 63.032750 94.028625 [silence]
Agent 72.329125 86.214625 where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i don't have a real since
Agent 86.214625 87.367250 [silence]
Agent 87.367250 95.195625 of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour
Customer 94.028625 99.465625 um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it
Agent 95.195625 96.636750 maybe
Agent 96.636750 112.842500 [silence]
Customer 99.465625 103.450250 or within i think people just started
Customer 103.450250 108.259125 you know no[t]- not being as careful with the loans that they were making
Customer 108.259125 110.167375 whenever
Customer 110.167375 113.302625 y[ou]- you know whenever they gave them out
Agent 112.842500 114.213750 uh-huh
Customer 113.302625 116.452000 i think maybe they didn't check into them enough
Agent 114.213750 122.218625 [silence]
Customer 116.452000 122.910875 or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so
Agent 122.218625 123.780250 yeah
Customer 122.910875 124.356750 yeah
Agent 123.780250 127.702250 it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people
Customer 124.356750 143.268875 [silence]
Agent 127.702250 130.630125 making loans and business decisions
Agent 130.630125 132.096250 on a
Agent 132.096250 134.890000 get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but
Agent 134.890000 139.011000 if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making
Agent 139.011000 144.529375 business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other company or
Customer 143.268875 145.546750 um-hum um-hum
Agent 144.529375 156.118750 i- i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move
Customer 145.546750 150.707625 [silence]
Customer 150.707625 152.126625 um-hum [noise]
Customer 152.126625 163.794375 [silence]
Agent 156.118750 164.081750 you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on
Customer 163.794375 165.636750 [noise] i'm not sure
Agent 164.081750 165.059000 [silence]
Agent 165.059000 171.903625 or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i
Customer 165.636750 173.622375 [silence]
Agent 171.903625 175.220125 i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing [laughter]
Customer 173.622375 184.089875 um-hum i know well [laughter] i'm um i know a little bit about it but i don't as much as i should know about it i'm a finance major here at Clarion
Agent 175.220125 176.142250 it
Agent 176.142250 183.552875 [silence]
Agent 183.552875 185.051125 okay
Customer 184.089875 195.760000 and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars
Agent 185.051125 206.288000 [silence]
Customer 195.760000 206.845625 so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it
Agent 206.288000 209.266875 well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk
Customer 206.845625 208.371125 [silence]
Customer 208.371125 210.651375 no i don't think so
Agent 209.266875 211.432875 oh okay
Customer 210.651375 221.998250 and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make
Agent 211.432875 221.156875 [silence]
Agent 221.156875 222.599750 uh-huh
Customer 221.998250 226.785625 and i think the S and L's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make
Agent 222.599750 226.377625 [silence]
Agent 226.377625 227.768875 okay
Customer 226.785625 229.733625 and i think if they would be more bound
Agent 227.768875 237.631250 [silence]
Customer 229.733625 236.787000 to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened
Customer 236.787000 253.402500 [silence]
Agent 237.631250 242.427250 well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and
Agent 242.427250 246.784875 nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that
Agent 246.784875 251.353750 that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up
Agent 251.353750 257.768500 it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your sense that that we now understand how bad it is
Customer 253.402500 254.856375 um-hum
Customer 254.856375 259.628000 [silence]
Agent 257.768500 259.786250 or is there more to be heard yet
Customer 259.628000 261.596875 um
Agent 259.786250 274.361000 [silence]
Customer 261.596875 274.760625 [noise] i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it [laughter-wasn't] making it wasn't as good news as it was i think it's still a[dding]- you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile
Agent 274.361000 281.022000 so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet of the problem or whether it [vocalized-noise]
Customer 274.760625 277.664375 [silence]
Customer 277.664375 289.500000 no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big [vocalized-noise] you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and L's still open
Agent 281.022000 289.124500 [silence]
Agent 289.124500 290.462375 uh-huh
Customer 289.500000 293.929000 and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this
Agent 290.462375 294.008500 [silence]
Customer 293.929000 295.242500 [silence]
Agent 294.008500 296.149875 to be caught in the land slide
Customer 295.242500 296.860000 um-hum
Agent 296.149875 298.417500 [silence]
Customer 296.860000 298.478875 um-hum
Agent 298.417500 302.288250 do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the the regular banks
Customer 298.478875 302.866625 [silence]
Agent 302.288250 310.224125 [silence]
Customer 302.866625 309.785375 i- i don't know i thin[k]- i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it
Customer 309.785375 327.199500 [silence]
Agent 310.224125 314.103250 it seems that i recall reading for the last
Agent 314.103250 321.551875 oh let's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks
Agent 321.551875 327.697875 of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela
Customer 327.199500 328.670875 um-hum
Agent 327.697875 334.921750 uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south
Customer 328.670875 355.010875 [silence]
Agent 334.921750 341.269375 resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done
Agent 341.269375 346.437750 the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans
Agent 346.437750 349.730125 i have this vague since that that could happen
Agent 349.730125 355.326375 that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost
Customer 355.010875 368.499250 [noise] oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just rea[ding]- i think it was in Venezuela i can't remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back
Agent 355.326375 367.827125 [silence]
Agent 367.827125 369.130875 um-hum
Customer 368.499250 371.384375 you know and they just they just wrote it right off
Agent 369.130875 378.352750 [silence]
Customer 371.384375 378.491000 i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back
Agent 378.352750 380.497750 and so you think that it's just gone
Customer 378.491000 380.051625 [silence]
Customer 380.051625 381.394000 um-hum
Agent 380.497750 389.201000 [silence]
Customer 381.394000 386.012500 um-hum yeah because_1 we['re]- we're you know we're talking about some companies that have just
Customer 386.012500 389.894500 like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more
Agent 389.201000 390.608375 okay
Customer 389.894500 392.566375 they just totally wrote it off their book
Agent 390.608375 392.321375 [silence]
Agent 392.321375 395.665750 do you think it is necessary to have the
Customer 392.566375 404.567875 [silence]
Agent 395.665750 398.857250 federal guaranty program
Agent 398.857250 405.681500 like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors
Customer 404.567875 405.937500 hum
Agent 405.681500 408.761500 which i don't think is what it was meant to do
Customer 405.937500 420.437500 [silence]
Agent 408.761500 416.148750 so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected
Agent 416.148750 419.483875 the possibility exists for for these sorts of
Agent 419.483875 421.065125 of problems
Customer 420.437500 427.492500 um-hum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing
Agent 421.065125 445.052750 [silence]
Customer 427.492500 432.807125 um it it's just it's just for you know safe purposes
Customer 432.807125 437.050875 you know in case something would happen um
Customer 437.050875 444.478750 yeah [vocalized-noise] as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something
Customer 444.478750 454.530375 [silence]
Agent 445.052750 446.284000 um
Agent 446.284000 448.971000 so your since is that the
Agent 448.971000 451.453500 that uh the
Agent 451.453500 458.636750 the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money
Customer 454.530375 455.946500 um-hum
Customer 455.946500 458.142125 [silence]
Customer 458.142125 459.632750 right
Agent 458.636750 465.505000 and given that the S and L's have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected
Customer 459.632750 464.708750 [silence]
Customer 464.708750 466.206000 um-hum
Agent 465.505000 472.684125 and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of
Customer 466.206000 472.060250 [silence]
Customer 472.060250 473.604250 um-hum
Agent 472.684125 475.681875 of dollars being protected
Customer 473.604250 494.932875 [silence]
Agent 475.681875 481.949000 it it seems like um [noise] there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts
Agent 481.949000 484.159250 uh it's if if you take
Agent 484.159250 495.248375 ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi[llion]- billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts
Customer 494.932875 496.432125 um-hum
Agent 495.248375 498.587000 and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and L's
Customer 496.432125 502.814375 [silence]
Agent 498.587000 503.058000 and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought
Customer 502.814375 504.247375 [noise] yeah
Agent 503.058000 504.886125 you know that the for
Customer 504.247375 511.381750 [silence]
Agent 504.886125 512.999875 i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got
Customer 511.381750 512.696375 um-hum
Customer 512.696375 521.210375 [silence]
Agent 512.999875 516.057375 accounts in thirty five different S and L's or
Agent 516.057375 523.330500 thirty or forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government seems to me like they've gotten around what was [laughter] intended to be the issue there
Customer 521.210375 524.711500 [laughter]
Agent 523.330500 525.059625 uh-huh
Customer 524.711500 528.776750 [silence]
Agent 525.059625 534.797375 i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and L's and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt
Customer 528.776750 530.175875 um-hum
Customer 530.175875 534.496875 [silence]
Customer 534.496875 536.390375 [laughter]
Agent 534.797375 542.308625 and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means means i'm not worried enough
Customer 536.390375 539.052625 [silence]
Customer 539.052625 541.582875 i think it could happen yeah
Customer 541.582875 542.601000 [silence]
Agent 542.308625 549.483000 uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things
Customer 542.601000 544.001875 um-hum
Customer 544.001875 549.339500 [silence]
Customer 549.339500 555.048500 i think it'll happen again but i think it'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again
Agent 549.483000 581.100625 [silence]
Customer 555.048500 564.157500 because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future
Customer 564.157500 571.097125 but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean you're gonna have to take some risks
Customer 571.097125 582.249375 and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance of it [vocalized-noise] possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future
Agent 581.100625 582.740375 uh-huh
Customer 582.249375 590.865625 [silence]
Agent 582.740375 586.931875 well perhaps if there are regulatory
Agent 586.931875 588.737875 um
Agent 588.737875 591.194250 constraints put back in place
Customer 590.865625 592.299000 um-hum
Agent 591.194250 597.350875 it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
Customer 592.299000 598.464000 [silence]
Agent 597.350875 598.464000 uh [vocalized-noise]
