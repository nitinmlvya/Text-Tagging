Agent 259.214125 269.130625 [silence]
Customer 263.204250 273.824625 so that they end up paying penalties for things that the government could have paid for the minute it was due and taken the five percent uh credit for early payment

Agent 485.051000 486.051000 that's great
Agent 486.051000 488.443375 [silence]
Agent 488.443375 491.102500 oh okay well that's a good idea

Agent 491.102500 492.670375 [silence]
Agent 492.670375 494.446625 sure

Customer 520.834875 530.089750 well i'm in Silicon Valley and they uh the the reason that the prices have gone up so high is that there just isn't anymore land left to build on most of the
