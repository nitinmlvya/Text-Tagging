Customer 45.777875 54.493125 yeah they uh they can like you [laughter-say] you can once you start using them they they're always r[eal]- real willing to raise those limits for you [laughter] that's for sure
Agent 46.212125 52.497875 [silence]
Agent 52.497875 65.989750 yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they don't have to be as credit conscious they can
Customer 54.493125 60.232250 [silence]
Customer 60.232250 61.481625 um-hum
Customer 61.481625 64.271500 [silence]
Customer 64.271500 67.257750 no they can afford to write off a lot more
Agent 65.989750 68.970000 yeah they can write off a lot more losses now
Customer 67.257750 68.271125 [silence]
Customer 68.271125 69.493500 um-hum
Agent 68.970000 77.987625 uh which which i kind of disagree uh with i'd rather them_1 going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates
Customer 69.493500 75.483625 [silence]
Customer 75.483625 77.681500 yeah [noise]
Customer 77.681500 81.988125 that's [noise] excuse me yeah that's true i uh
Agent 77.987625 90.998625 [silence]
Customer 81.988125 93.496250 well i can't see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i can't imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because_1 the[re's]-
Agent 90.998625 101.268375 yeah i i've heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have
Customer 93.496250 99.494750 [silence]
Customer 99.494750 105.473375 yeah well that make y[ou]- you know that makes sense i guess if they're they're not willing to write off as much but
Agent 101.268375 104.474750 [silence]
Agent 104.474750 105.980750 yeah
Customer 105.473375 119.235625 you know it there's a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we s[ent]- we'll take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars c[ost]- or a year for the just the fee and everything it
Agent 105.980750 113.994500 [silence]
Agent 113.994500 115.770125 yeah [noise]
Agent 115.770125 126.482375 [silence]
Customer 119.235625 123.040000 i don't know i just i have a hard time i like i say i
Customer 123.040000 134.239125 working in a financial institution i just i'm really rate conscious i guess and can't see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy
Agent 126.482375 127.797750 yeah
Agent 127.797750 130.491125 [silence]
Agent 130.491125 132.621000 we[ll]- yeah
Agent 132.621000 147.497750 well well peop[le]- people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they don't look at at spending uh eighteen percent [laughter] on on credit it's uh for some reason they don't look at it that way
Customer 134.239125 139.292250 [silence]
Customer 139.292250 140.495375 um-hum
Customer 140.495375 142.751250 [silence]
Customer 142.751250 143.993000 yeah
Customer 143.993000 146.991250 [silence]
Customer 146.991250 158.975375 yep there's i imagine there's there's quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they don't have to ch[arge]- you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that can't pay it off monthly and get
Agent 147.497750 153.689375 [silence]
Agent 153.689375 155.000375 that
Agent 155.000375 156.768000 [silence]
Agent 156.768000 165.284250 that's that's true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them_1 off but there's
Customer 158.975375 161.775750 [silence]
Customer 161.775750 163.236500 um-hum
Customer 163.236500 167.987375 [silence]
Agent 165.284250 171.993375 sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them_1 off but
Customer 167.987375 169.484125 yeah
Customer 169.484125 170.808250 [silence]
Customer 170.808250 172.485625 yeah that's true
Agent 171.993375 182.449875 but the people who who can't afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it it's sort of like the federal government [laughter]
Customer 172.485625 177.275625 [silence]
Customer 177.275625 178.686250 um-hum
Customer 178.686250 180.490750 [silence]
Customer 180.490750 184.982250 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-exactly] that's true but
Agent 182.449875 196.994500 [silence]
Customer 184.982250 193.276500 yeah i uh i- i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt they've got it just seems like they're
Customer 193.276500 202.484000 they right now they can't afford to buy anymore because they're up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know that's part of the reason i think everything's kind of stalled out but
Agent 196.994500 198.998750 yes that's right
Agent 198.998750 201.986625 [silence]
Agent 201.986625 207.660625 well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh
Customer 202.484000 206.326500 [silence]
Customer 206.326500 207.751000 um-hum
Agent 207.660625 218.176375 uh i think it would only mean that they'd they'd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and they'd probably make just as much money they just wouldn't write off as many losses
Customer 207.751000 213.001375 [silence]
Customer 213.001375 214.509625 yeah
Customer 214.509625 216.491625 [silence]
Customer 216.491625 228.469375 that exactly you know when that thing was they were trying to pass thr[ough]- thr[ough]- that through Congress they the thing that Congress didn't realize is that yeah they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and you know it would slow you know they were trying to
Agent 218.176375 230.983375 [silence]
Customer 228.469375 242.949625 pick things up but it would just it do wouldn't do any good because you know the banks aren't stupid they're going to realize that they can't you know they can't keep affording to write off five percent if they're only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent
Agent 230.983375 233.475000 yeah that's that's right
Agent 233.475000 237.488125 [silence]
Agent 237.488125 238.997000 yes uh
Agent 238.997000 239.997000 [silence]
Agent 239.997000 252.735125 well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didn't look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and that's in uh in real estate and other things and it's the same with credit cards
Customer 242.949625 247.999750 [silence]
Customer 247.999750 249.309625 um-hum
Customer 249.309625 250.332750 [silence]

Customer 251.822625 253.490125 that's true
Agent 252.735125 259.499250 [silence]
Customer 253.490125 254.515000 [silence]
