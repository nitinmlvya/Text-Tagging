Agent 0.000000 1.030250 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 7.217500 well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and [laughter] as it may be
Agent 1.030250 48.285125 [silence]
Customer 7.217500 16.125875 is to first of all put an end to these kinds of uh hidden user fees and uh
Customer 16.125875 20.653625 um other types of uh tricks that have been used
Customer 20.653625 34.307500 to help mask the size of this thing let's get a hold of what the real true sized of it is and then let's deal with it immediately and as quickly as possible even if it means some short term higher taxes
Customer 34.307500 43.570375 to get it down and uh then let's try to make some reforms with the the congressional community ha ha [laughter]
Customer 43.570375 48.330875 try and make it so that we don't have this problem in the future
Agent 48.285125 53.134750 well i have to i have to say that i would be very in favor
Customer 48.330875 79.826000 [silence]
Agent 53.134750 54.825000 of
Agent 54.825000 65.019250 a situation where the revenue generation activities of the government such as the IRS
Agent 65.019250 68.249375 are monitored and
Agent 68.249375 71.874625 spending for year
Agent 71.874625 74.006375 X plus one
Agent 74.006375 80.342750 can go no higher than the revenues brought in during year X
Customer 79.826000 80.823250 you know
Agent 80.342750 86.233375 so that uh forget about this balanced budget this would immediately force them
Customer 80.823250 97.542125 [silence]
Agent 86.233375 95.438250 to say well geez um you know last year was a bad year and we've only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh
Agent 95.438250 105.286250 i realize that i'm off by a factor of about five but [laughter] we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million
Customer 97.542125 99.477875 [laughter]
Customer 99.477875 105.123750 [silence]
Customer 105.123750 115.600000 i- i just keep seeing unfortunately the p[roblem]- a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people
Agent 105.286250 128.251750 [silence]
Customer 115.600000 123.617250 bought into this notion that well we can just uh we don't need a higher taxes certainly not they get enough of our money already and
Customer 123.617250 129.367500 the deficit doesn't seem to affect me in my daily life and routine so so what
Agent 128.251750 130.561375 it's going to affect your kids
Customer 129.367500 135.830750 yeah i know but you notice these people are only now starting to think ahead
Agent 130.561375 132.897625 [noise] [vocalized-noise]
Agent 132.897625 134.350125 [silence]
Agent 134.350125 139.871250 well i- i think this has always been the case with the American public in that
Customer 135.830750 148.115750 [silence]
Agent 139.871250 148.957875 it's made up of a bunch of special interest groups it's only recently that special interest groups have started to exert more power
Customer 148.115750 149.515375 um-hum
Agent 148.957875 158.164250 uh for instance retirees they've started to up social security benefits it used to be so social security was just the final safety net
Customer 149.515375 157.716000 [silence]
Customer 157.716000 159.072375 yeah
Agent 158.164250 162.446750 but it's not that way anymore uh now you've got people who have
Customer 159.072375 172.449625 [silence]
Agent 162.446750 172.986625 uh sixty thousand in tax free income because they invested wisely during their working years and they're still collecting social security and all of that money is tax free
Customer 172.449625 174.020500 um-hum
Agent 172.986625 180.722750 i'm sorry i think that um all of the investment income regardless of how you invested should be taxable
Customer 174.020500 186.719750 [silence]
Agent 180.722750 187.192000 and the thing is that you should loose social security benefits based on how much income you have
Customer 186.719750 204.710250 yeah the only the only problem comes down as that a lot of people will scream and yell especially the AARP because they were yelled that well we paid for this all along was this a hidden secret tax the whole time that's our money that they don't want to give back to us now [vocalized-noise]
Agent 187.192000 200.710125 [silence]
Agent 200.710125 209.829375 uh yeah i- i- i- i agree i think that social security ought to be done away with and put into the uh [vocalized-noise] tax
Customer 204.710250 209.141750 [silence]
Customer 209.141750 211.066625 um-hum
Agent 209.829375 214.619000 and that's what it is so go ahead and put it in there and uh
Customer 211.066625 239.274750 [silence]
Agent 214.619000 223.911500 uh you know i mean they're treating it as a tax they're treating the money as tax revenue it's not something that they're putting aside for later use it goes into the general fund whether or not
Agent 223.911500 229.683000 it wants to to go there that's that's were it goes and it's being used so i mean um
Agent 229.683000 240.106375 uh my personal opinion out here in California we just instituted term limits on the uh Senate and House for the state legislature
Customer 239.274750 240.850500 um-hum
Agent 240.106375 243.734375 and i don't know whether it's going to have
Customer 240.850500 251.659500 [silence]
Agent 243.734375 252.808875 uh the affect that of course all the the career politicos here say oh my God you know you're going to have a bunch of amateurs running the state legislature
Customer 251.659500 253.516250 [noise]
Agent 252.808875 258.082000 well well so what [laughter] they can't do any worse than the guys that are in there now and [vocalized-noise]
Customer 253.516250 254.960875 [laughter]
Customer 254.960875 256.078375 [silence]
Customer 256.078375 261.911375 well yeah we have that out here in New York too you know with governor Mario King Mario and
Agent 258.082000 259.978625 [silence]
Agent 259.978625 262.026250 [laughter]
Customer 261.911375 271.039500 the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget
Agent 262.026250 270.372250 [silence]
Agent 270.372250 271.734875 yeah
Customer 271.039500 276.480875 in this state which is delayed eternally and then they want to kill each other you know [laughter]
Agent 271.734875 275.678000 [silence]
Agent 275.678000 282.456750 well i think that what we may end up with with the term limits is you get more people involved in government
Customer 276.480875 281.763750 [silence]
Customer 281.763750 283.021625 um-hum
Agent 282.456750 290.171625 you get more people seeing how it should work and i think what that will do is that will allow people to say well wait a minute
Customer 283.021625 299.522000 [silence]
Agent 290.171625 299.522000 we've got to compromise we've got to work on something we need more of a vision and less of uh God i'll grab my money and do everything i can
