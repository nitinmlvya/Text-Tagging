Agent 0.000000 0.475750 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.339000 [noise]
Customer 0.339000 6.846875 it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent
Agent 0.475750 13.347500 [silence]
Customer 6.846875 14.200000 um they aren't as as responsive both to like bad economic times you don't have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing
Agent 13.347500 14.681750 yeah
Customer 14.200000 21.991500 but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean
Agent 14.681750 20.407625 [silence]
Agent 20.407625 26.989875 yeah yeah see i work for a really small company it's just me and my boss [laughter]
Customer 21.991500 26.151250 [silence]
Customer 26.151250 27.675000 oh wow
Agent 26.989875 37.707500 so it's really small and i think it's really nice because you know it's it's real easy we don't really have much to do but it's just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or
Customer 27.675000 42.096000 [silence]
Agent 37.707500 42.963750 you know it just goes straight from me to him and we don't have to go through a bunch of people like you're saying but
Customer 42.096000 43.478625 right
Agent 42.963750 53.713625 but sometimes it's kind of bad because if i'm sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless i'm you know have to stay in bed because i'm the only one there yeah
Customer 43.478625 51.366125 [silence]
Customer 51.366125 64.396625 there is that i mean well and then i guess again i- i gue[ss]- like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but
Agent 53.713625 63.473000 [silence]
Agent 63.473000 64.934875 yeah
Customer 64.396625 70.505375 um i imagine and and that's nice but uh it's w[ould]- it's also nice to be able to uh
Agent 64.934875 66.890750 [silence]
Agent 66.890750 68.234500 yeah
Agent 68.234500 74.706500 [silence]

Customer 92.449375 96.664500 [silence]
Customer 96.664500 98.300000 um-hum
Agent 97.502625 98.994750 so
Customer 98.300000 107.497625 you know one other benefit that tha[t]- just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in [noise] sometimes big companies will pay for like education
Agent 98.994750 106.650000 [silence]
Agent 106.650000 108.226125 oh yeah yeah
Customer 107.497625 118.348375 i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing
Agent 108.226125 112.858500 [silence]
Agent 112.858500 114.196750 yeah
Agent 114.196750 117.670250 [silence]

Customer 120.097000 121.766750 [silence]
Customer 121.766750 123.079500 uh-huh
Customer 123.079500 131.341000 [silence]
Agent 126.211625 131.748875 as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses they'll reimburse her
Customer 131.341000 132.688000 uh-huh
Agent 131.748875 134.723375 so that's pretty nice so that she could move up in the company
Customer 132.688000 134.085000 [silence]
Customer 134.085000 135.572875 yeah
Agent 134.723375 137.887500 and that's pretty nice my job won't do that [laughter]
Customer 135.572875 136.990625 [silence]
Customer 136.990625 139.418000 [laughter]
Agent 137.887500 139.606500 [laughter]
Customer 139.418000 140.262750 yeah
Agent 139.606500 154.821125 [silence]
Customer 140.262750 151.383875 yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to
Customer 151.383875 155.626875 um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast
Agent 154.821125 156.236500 yeah
Customer 155.626875 165.860000 and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people
Agent 156.236500 165.114375 [silence]
Agent 165.114375 166.385000 yeah
Customer 165.860000 173.336875 of course i guess if there's only the two of you you'll i mean i guess y[ou're]- you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so
Agent 166.385000 172.368375 [silence]
Agent 172.368375 173.739500 yeah
Customer 173.336875 180.516250 so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for
Agent 173.739500 187.011125 [silence]
Customer 180.516250 181.689000 [silence]
Customer 181.689000 187.560500 things like uh like if if there's some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids
Agent 187.011125 188.396750 yeah that's
Customer 187.560500 190.007500 [noise] bigger companies might have something like that
Agent 188.396750 189.418125 [silence]
Agent 189.418125 191.033500 yeah that would be nice
Customer 190.007500 191.022500 [silence]
Customer 191.022500 200.175375 and uh um [noise] like like it's their i guess another advantage might be that uh if th[ey]- if it's big a big enough company and it has multiple sites
Agent 191.033500 199.730500 [silence]
Agent 199.730500 200.978750 yeah
Customer 200.175375 206.946625 um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country
Agent 200.978750 206.350750 [silence]
Agent 206.350750 215.340000 yeah they moved uh my dad worked for i'm not even sure where but they moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas

Customer 216.444000 231.910500 [silence]
Agent 216.758750 222.200625 we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in San Antonio for a while and all
Agent 222.200625 232.242875 i mean i guess it's nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever
Customer 231.910500 239.900375 [vocalized-noise] which i guess i being with a small company you wouldn't get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not
Agent 232.242875 240.261750 [silence]
Customer 239.900375 255.619875 [silence]
Agent 240.261750 249.833875 yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because_1 you know we weren't just living in Dallas and didn't exactly know just everything about Dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that
Agent 249.833875 256.387500 if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to to get to San Antonio very much so
Customer 255.619875 258.063625 oh you had family in San Antonio
Agent 256.387500 257.496250 [silence]

Customer 263.710500 264.959875 okay
Agent 263.992375 271.249125 so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different
Customer 264.959875 270.986000 [silence]
Customer 270.986000 278.331750 [noise] see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company
Agent 271.249125 277.438500 [silence]
Agent 277.438500 278.979375 [laughter-yeah]
