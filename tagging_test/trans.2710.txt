Customer 211.770750 222.988375 [silence]
Agent 212.994375 218.288125 but it's hard i mean it's it's tempting when you see something to say well i'll just charge it
Agent 218.288125 230.981125 and sometimes i'll do that but usually i- i will try to pay everything off the next month or the ones that that usually have an outstanding balance all the time i'll i'll pay more than the minimum payment

Agent 369.711125 371.206500 yeah

Agent 375.248125 377.482500 oh okay
Agent 377.482500 385.479750 [silence]
Customer 377.499875 386.985375 you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late you're thirty [laughter-days] late
Agent 385.479750 389.701125 they don't they don't recognize any time difference do they
Customer 386.985375 388.496500 [silence]
Customer 388.496500 390.489500 right
Agent 389.701125 390.701125 [silence]
Customer 390.489500 401.014125 right [laughter] and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of
Agent 390.701125 392.293500 ooh that's scary
Agent 392.293500 393.308125 [laughter]
Agent 393.308125 401.975250 [silence]
Customer 401.014125 407.487625 [silence]
Agent 401.975250 408.753500 that's something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like
Customer 407.487625 413.246625 um-hum well you know you you can do that i believe it costs about ten dollars
Agent 408.753500 412.495375 [silence]
Agent 412.495375 415.494500 might be worth it for peace of mind
Customer 413.246625 414.310375 [silence]
Customer 414.310375 424.707500 oh yeah it is it is you might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you [laughter-didn't] even know it you know you i mean you might think you're paying something on time or
Agent 415.494500 430.481875 [silence]
Customer 424.707500 425.714625 [silence]
Customer 425.714625 431.280125 and you by that day and you're thir[ty]- [vocalized-noise] thirty days is not real bad though anyway
Agent 430.481875 431.996625 yeah
Customer 431.280125 442.476125 if you've got a charge off on your credit re[port]- report or something like that that's when it really gets bad or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days you know
Agent 431.996625 442.768625 [silence]
Customer 442.476125 444.475375 things like that
Agent 442.768625 444.227375 really
Agent 444.227375 456.020375 i think that Discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back
Customer 444.475375 454.974000 [silence]
Customer 454.974000 456.497625 um-hum
Agent 456.020375 458.996000 and since they don't have the yearly fee
Customer 456.497625 458.487875 [silence]
Customer 458.487875 462.495750 do they charge a lot of interest on that card i don't
Agent 458.996000 461.290500 [silence]
Agent 461.290500 470.495375 i don't know i've never i haven't gotten one just because it's i- i felt like with Visa and MasterCard and American Express you didn't need another one
Customer 462.495750 464.225625 [silence]
Customer 464.225625 465.740250 uh-huh
Customer 465.740250 469.756250 [silence]
Customer 469.756250 471.304125 um-hum
Agent 470.495375 476.261250 i would think it wouldn't be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges
Customer 471.304125 476.991750 [silence]
Agent 476.261250 477.490125 [silence]
Customer 476.991750 479.033500 yeah
Agent 477.490125 480.697250 so that that wouldn't be too bad
Customer 479.033500 480.986625 [noise]
Agent 480.697250 500.192625 [silence]
Customer 480.986625 492.984875 well always watch out for s[omebody]- anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty one and twenty two percent interest
Customer 492.984875 496.166000 i know i had a charge with uh Spiegel
Customer 496.166000 507.999750 [laughter] and i hadn't read the uh terms of the credit agreement really and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance
Agent 500.192625 501.984250 yeah
Agent 501.984250 507.242250 [silence]
Agent 507.242250 508.489625 [laughter]
Customer 507.999750 511.740750 off you know and i looked at the credit card agreement one day
Agent 508.489625 513.996000 [silence]
Customer 511.740750 514.981875 and it was like twenty three percent interest
Agent 513.996000 515.480250 holy cow
Customer 514.981875 516.977375 [laughter]
Agent 515.480250 520.778250 [silence]
Customer 516.977375 528.194500 and that's the one bill that i hurry up hurried and paid up and and i've always watched it since then you really have to watch those interest rates
Agent 520.778250 523.259250 definitely that's awful
Agent 523.259250 528.498375 [silence]
Customer 528.194500 531.462750 [silence]
Agent 528.498375 533.993125 i mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to [laughter-so]
Customer 531.462750 542.014625 that's true [laughter] so anyway they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in in Texas but there there are a couple of states that can
Agent 533.993125 538.305750 [silence]
Agent 538.305750 540.474000 well that's great
Agent 540.474000 547.777875 [silence]
Customer 542.014625 550.186250 and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta [laughter] Atlanta Georgia [laughter]
Agent 547.777875 551.264875 i'll try to remember that one [laughter]
Customer 550.186250 552.236375 [silence]
Agent 551.264875 552.186500 [silence]
Agent 552.186500 553.522875 oh
Customer 552.236375 553.982625 well
Agent 553.522875 554.760500 [silence]
Customer 553.982625 557.995375 [silence]
Agent 554.760500 556.272875 well
Agent 556.272875 558.612500 see i was trying to think if there was anything else
Customer 557.995375 559.979125 [laughter]
Agent 558.612500 559.129250 [laughter]
Agent 559.129250 559.713750 [noise]
Agent 559.713750 560.774250 [silence]
Customer 559.979125 570.969750 [silence]
Agent 560.774250 561.631375 um
Agent 561.631375 562.692250 [silence]
Agent 562.692250 571.986500 so i guess the worst problem i ever had with with a credit card though was um i got a an item on my bill that i had never purchased
Customer 570.969750 572.483125 um-hum
Agent 571.986500 584.510125 i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it and i changed my mind but then they went ahead and charged it on my account
Customer 572.483125 577.997875 [silence]
Customer 577.997875 579.499125 um-hum
Customer 579.499125 580.502125 [silence]
