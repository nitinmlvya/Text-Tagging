Agent 0.000000 0.844875 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 8.670250 [noise] well i think that there's uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um
Agent 0.844875 20.392125 [silence]
Customer 8.670250 21.953750 health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um [noise] facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day
Agent 20.392125 31.626000 i- i definitely agree on that um i'm working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that they're desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever

Agent 49.533375 52.255875 and i've heard of a lot of other companies providing that
Agent 52.255875 54.041500 that would be something to look forward to
Agent 54.041500 55.664750 um
Agent 55.664750 56.753375 [noise]
Agent 56.753375 58.644750 let's see

Agent 61.541750 64.919750 [laughter] well a lot depends on the job though [laughter]

Agent 69.360375 81.467375 [silence]
Customer 70.990375 82.128125 you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that
Agent 81.467375 83.012125 right

Customer 87.662500 89.657750 and
Agent 88.478750 92.625500 i suppose that does depend on the type of job type of environment you're in
Customer 89.657750 91.877875 [silence]
Customer 91.877875 93.487500 [noise] yeah

Agent 112.093125 113.751250 but
Agent 113.751250 128.902875 [silence]
Customer 114.765625 123.320000 i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of
Customer 123.320000 129.862625 um [noise] like the family in some in somebody's in the way that somebody relates to the work place
Agent 128.902875 130.541250 how so
Customer 129.862625 136.625125 um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more
Agent 130.541250 147.683375 [silence]
Customer 136.625125 139.251375 they get um allowances for
Customer 139.251375 148.225000 um you know have being married or having children i don't really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case
Agent 147.683375 150.182875 well they do
Customer 148.225000 152.022625 but um they get housing and stuff like that [noise]
Agent 150.182875 151.872000 yeah
Agent 151.872000 155.572125 yeah i have friends that are in the military and they do get quite a lot of perks
Customer 152.022625 154.652000 [silence]
Customer 154.652000 160.737375 and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that
Agent 155.572125 159.178750 [silence]
Agent 159.178750 161.482250 [noise] right right
Customer 160.737375 170.910250 but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i don't know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how
Agent 161.482250 191.795750 [silence]
Customer 170.910250 182.736625 you know here he'd spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places he'd worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing
Customer 182.736625 185.615250 some kind of consideration there would be nice as well
Customer 185.615250 188.890375 i don't know what would be the solution i suppose uh
Customer 188.890375 192.383625 not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place
Agent 191.795750 193.231875 right
Customer 192.383625 195.743750 if they're just gonna pork you in the end
Agent 193.231875 195.042500 [silence]
Agent 195.042500 204.905125 um what a lot what a lot of companies do is fa[r]- as far as their health benefits are concerned the insurance provides um coverage for the spouse and or family
Customer 195.743750 205.487750 [silence]
Agent 204.905125 208.317125 in a lot of cases i know that's the case in my office at least
Customer 205.487750 207.168125 yeah
Customer 207.168125 209.010000 yeah
Agent 208.317125 216.575625 they'll provide minimum benefits for your spouse and depend[ent]- codependent children not like the case applies to me but um
Customer 209.010000 218.053125 [silence]
Agent 216.575625 218.858500 it is nice that they offer it
Customer 218.053125 221.238125 yeah it's a good consideration for families
Agent 218.858500 222.657750 [silence]
Customer 221.238125 225.063125 that's absolute necessity in today's world and price
Agent 222.657750 226.018500 definitely and health insurance costs
Customer 225.063125 227.850500 man they're getting so expensive
Agent 226.018500 230.403125 [silence]
Customer 227.850500 232.172250 right now i don't have any health insurance it's kind of disturbing unless you

Customer 239.484250 250.513750 it's a long road [noise] but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh they've got a really minimum plan and it'll cover you you know and as a student you don't need a whole lot if
Agent 241.093875 248.099000 [silence]
Agent 248.099000 249.413250 um-hum
Agent 249.413250 251.610250 [silence]
Customer 250.513750 260.752750 if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then
Agent 251.610250 252.808375 [noise]
Agent 252.808375 254.631875 [laughter]
