Agent 68.170125 75.782250 you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much o[f]- other types of benefits and
Customer 74.817375 76.152875 um-hum
Agent 75.782250 80.505000 so yeah i would i'd say health care is way up there especially for anybody with kids um

Customer 79.653875 80.966250 yeah
Agent 80.505000 86.346625 and that's one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about tak[ing]- changing jobs is you know
Customer 80.966250 92.314750 [silence]
Agent 86.346625 93.095250 you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work
Customer 92.314750 93.697000 um-hum
Agent 93.095250 98.110375 and um also um vacation time too is a is a big one for me

Customer 98.743250 103.833875 [silence]
Customer 103.833875 105.249125 yeah
Agent 104.943125 109.352250 um because_1 i've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any
Customer 105.249125 106.627375 hm
Customer 106.627375 109.132625 [silence]
Customer 109.132625 110.627250 right
Agent 109.352250 120.356375 and some that sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so that's not so bad um you know it's kind of a give and take kind of thing i think
Customer 110.627250 111.916875 right
Customer 111.916875 115.556875 [silence]
Customer 115.556875 116.918000 yeah

Customer 119.881500 121.276250 um-hum
Agent 120.356375 134.510000 um i say that uh health care is probably definitely number one though uh you can wind up just l[osing]- you know l[osing]- all your salary can't [laughter-can't] [laughter-even] begin to pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something
Customer 121.276250 129.499625 [silence]

Agent 135.779375 143.838250 [silence]
Customer 136.277250 143.145250 um and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices [laughter]
Customer 143.145250 144.443500 and who to go with
Agent 143.838250 145.435750 yeah
Customer 144.443500 147.277500 and that really helped us out a great deal

Customer 147.277500 148.715625 so
Customer 148.715625 153.698250 but my husband does get vacation and it's worked out really good for us too

Agent 154.691750 156.599125 ye[ah]-
Agent 156.599125 163.918750 yeah flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well um because_1 that makes a big difference my wife works part time

Customer 159.708000 161.288750 yeah
Customer 161.288750 163.250125 [silence]

Customer 185.854625 187.379375 right
Agent 186.643250 201.394875 and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because_1 i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know and even if it's summer sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them_1
