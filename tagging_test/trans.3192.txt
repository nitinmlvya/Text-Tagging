Agent 24.237500 28.556375 on their tax returns only because uh
Agent 28.556375 39.784125 the way the IRS does things they're not gonna give you any breaks i mean they they encourage you to cheat because if you should get audited they're gonna get you for everything and and some more on top of that
Customer 38.983250 45.132250 and then they're gonna tax you on that for or they're gonna give you an interest on it i know somebody that it happened to [noise]

Agent 45.714125 73.567750 [silence]
Customer 48.373500 62.842625 but i get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer expenses when i sat down when we were through and i sat down with our accountant and we did it

Agent 83.319500 107.699625 [silence]
Customer 91.802500 100.363625 sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would [distrupt/disrupt] disrupt our
Customer 100.363625 108.050625 travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said it's not worth it i'm not working any more

Agent 108.342625 115.065750 [silence]
Agent 115.065750 116.367375 well see
Agent 116.367375 124.763250 well Texas we are a community property state so we have some a little bit different rules than you have in the separate property state such as uh where you in Ohio but
Customer 116.992500 123.495750 [silence]
Customer 123.495750 126.500750 do you pay a state income income tax
Agent 124.763250 132.657500 w[e]- we do not have state income taxes yet but we see it on the horizon it hadn't hit here yet but we do have

Agent 132.657500 134.358500 [silence]
Agent 134.358500 137.613250 yeah but how much do you pay in sales tax
Customer 136.090500 140.019250 [noise] uh sales tax we pay seven percent
Agent 137.613250 138.980000 [silence]
Agent 138.980000 143.350375 okay we're at eight and a fourth right now
Customer 140.019250 142.328000 [silence]
Customer 142.328000 150.886250 you're so you're higher but you get {out-of-towners} on that then you get everyone on your state uh sales tax which is good
Agent 143.350375 148.243625 [silence]
Agent 148.243625 149.754000 true
Agent 149.754000 151.736500 true true
Customer 150.886250 159.839250 as uh the income tax what's not fair is paying in the city you live in right now we're living where there is a reciprocity
Agent 151.736500 164.031000 [silence]
Customer 159.839250 164.671375 so if you do pay more in the city you're working you don't owe your city anything
Agent 164.031000 165.349125 no
Customer 164.671375 173.827750 and this year well my husband's actually keeping track of all his time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the difference because_1 our city is a little bit less
Agent 165.349125 172.556625 [silence]
Agent 172.556625 183.798750 but are you of the fact that when you prepare your tax return now obviously if you have an error in the IRS's favor they're going to be very quick to come back to you and say hey you owe this much more tax
Customer 173.827750 183.481000 [silence]
Customer 183.481000 184.646375 right
Agent 183.798750 192.006000 but if there is an error in your favor they do not come back to you and say oh you get a refund they
Customer 184.646375 190.619500 [silence]
Customer 190.619500 194.308750 oh abso[lutely]- and much less they don't pay you an interest
Agent 192.006000 193.085125 [silence]
Agent 193.085125 197.674250 yeah so you know if what's fair for the goose is good for the gander
Customer 194.308750 227.468000 [silence]
Agent 197.674250 207.733000 and unfortunately the IRS is saying you know we have screwed y'all so many times that's why so many tax payers are starting to cheat more and more which is a shame
Agent 207.733000 215.331625 but i think the IRS has brought it on {themself} because they're not being very helpful to those who have made errors
Agent 215.331625 227.875000 and i think if they w[ould]- i think if they would come back and say hey look this is wrong this is the way it should be done we're gonna give you some refunds and so forth and actually show an honest effort to be good on both sides of the fence we wanna collect as much tax we also wanna give back as much tax
Customer 227.468000 228.769625 right
Agent 227.875000 230.634875 i- i think that you'd have a better feeling
Customer 228.769625 232.922750 [silence]
Agent 230.634875 233.360750 and you'd have a lot better tax returns being done
Customer 232.922750 238.077000 well and it is now to the point that it has gotten so um
Agent 233.360750 252.486500 [silence]
Customer 238.077000 245.970375 so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and i've done it with transfers and sale of property
Customer 245.970375 253.886250 but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it let's go see a CPA well
Agent 252.486500 257.838500 and yet if you went to visit five different CPA's you'd get five different answers
Customer 253.886250 256.349125 [silence]
Customer 256.349125 269.973750 that's what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment [laughter-you] you have excelled she said i cannot find one
Agent 257.838500 276.062625 [silence]
Customer 269.973750 274.745125 thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records
Customer 274.745125 278.448625 all year long as i go one on twice a month one on
Agent 276.062625 281.949625 i think uh you sound like one of the type of clients i'd love to have [laughter]
Customer 278.448625 288.494250 [laughter] well that's what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it
Agent 281.949625 293.132000 [silence]
Customer 288.494250 298.850000 uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because_1 i said well i've got all every[thing]-
Agent 293.132000 293.866375 but
Agent 293.866375 298.850000 [silence]
