Agent 98.071375 110.738875 [silence]
Customer 99.186000 111.365125 uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to Washington or to the state and they say they're going to send some back it's like giving yourself a tra[nsfusion]- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion
Agent 110.738875 112.019375 yeah
Customer 111.365125 112.790750 you know what i mean
Agent 112.019375 113.390375 yeah

Agent 113.390375 118.995250 [silence]
Agent 118.995250 120.643750 yeah there you go
Customer 120.465250 131.326625 right because uh y[eah]- there's an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
Agent 120.643750 121.903375 [laughter]
Agent 121.903375 138.435500 [silence]
Customer 131.326625 138.922000 and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you
Agent 138.435500 139.660125 right
Customer 138.922000 140.168125 [silence]
Agent 139.660125 153.323375 yeah i don't know i don't doesn't seem like they're doing much with it neither i mean there's plans there and now with the voting and and people you know getting into senate and government and stuff i me[an]- they have nice plans and

Customer 149.870000 151.212750 um-hum
Customer 151.212750 165.177625 [silence]
Agent 153.323375 165.121375 um but [laughter] they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with [laughter-all] the money because if their plans don't work you know and the taxes get raised
Agent 165.121375 170.642250 i don't know i'm not you know really into politics i don['t]- really understand it but
Customer 165.177625 166.968625 that's it

Customer 168.847750 172.433000 [silence]
Agent 170.642250 172.248875 it's just
Agent 172.248875 174.371000 you know [laughter]
Customer 172.433000 179.957125 well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
Agent 174.371000 186.245250 [silence]
Customer 179.957125 186.845625 uh it's almost like they'll spend as much as the they were were they're allowed to collect you know
Agent 186.245250 187.716500 right
Customer 186.845625 194.979750 um [noise] i there's an interesting proposal that's been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax
Agent 187.716500 202.627500 [silence]
Customer 194.979750 203.547875 uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amou[nt]- i mean you you take your total salary
Agent 202.627500 203.883000 um-hum
Customer 203.547875 211.683625 uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't h[ave]- owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had
Agent 203.883000 211.523125 [silence]
Agent 211.523125 212.653875 hm
Customer 211.683625 221.102500 and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after y[ou]- you know after you uh figure out [noise] you know who's in your family
Agent 212.653875 220.519500 [silence]
Agent 220.519500 222.513250 right huh
Customer 221.102500 229.295875 and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the IRS and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know
Agent 222.513250 227.706000 [silence]
Agent 227.706000 230.806875 yeah that could be nice [laughter]

Agent 230.806875 232.155125 huh
Customer 230.875750 240.546250 i i'd like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a l[ot]- you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and i'm sure they'll fight it tooth and nail but
Agent 232.155125 243.887375 [silence]
Customer 240.546250 245.076000 i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans
Agent 243.887375 245.537250 right
Customer 245.076000 258.387625 [noise] i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
Agent 245.537250 247.029125 yeah
Agent 247.029125 257.622375 [silence]
