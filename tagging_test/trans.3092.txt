Customer 185.906125 187.575250 it would be just futile
Agent 186.914375 195.137500 and it it would be just basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center which is not right exactly
Customer 187.575250 188.762000 [silence]
Customer 188.762000 190.388125 and they would not have the quality

Customer 194.661625 197.155375 yeah no i understand that totally
Agent 195.137500 196.585625 [silence]
Agent 196.585625 209.238875 besides which it would be easier uh there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner and to go to work

Agent 224.910500 234.393250 [silence]
Customer 231.209625 233.462250 from your salary that you are getting

Agent 234.393250 247.824875 i think tha[t]- i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a a a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper
Customer 235.265750 236.750000 acceptable
