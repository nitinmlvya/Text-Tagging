Customer 50.010500 51.135625 what
Customer 51.135625 58.524125 since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because_1 Virginia does have a state tax
Agent 51.933125 56.050250 [silence]
Agent 56.050250 58.035000 [noise] well

Agent 68.664500 69.789375 [silence]
Agent 69.789375 71.180125 yeah
Customer 70.175000 79.649375 because_1 i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck
Agent 71.180125 74.006500 [silence]
Agent 74.006500 75.484750 uh-huh

Customer 113.077375 116.369500 and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds
Agent 116.076750 117.541625 oh
Customer 116.369500 120.192875 well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes
Agent 117.541625 121.773000 [silence]
Customer 120.192875 122.732125 but it seems like it would pay itself off
Agent 121.773000 123.820625 oh well it will
Customer 122.732125 127.277625 so you know [laughter] what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know
Agent 123.820625 125.824000 [silence]
Agent 125.824000 128.276625 probably the first season

Customer 144.410500 146.276625 no huh
Agent 144.962750 152.536875 so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws
Customer 146.276625 151.562125 [silence]
Customer 151.562125 164.059000 um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe

Customer 182.494125 189.936875 on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up
Agent 186.473625 187.998250 oh
Agent 187.998250 190.236125 [silence]
Customer 189.936875 194.959125 you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year
