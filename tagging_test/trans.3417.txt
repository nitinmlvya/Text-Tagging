Customer 3.775500 6.024000 i guess my [noise]
Customer 6.024000 8.068875 initial view is
Customer 8.068875 15.244875 our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts but
Customer 15.244875 18.905375 among industrialized nations we have one of the
Customer 18.905375 29.862500 lowest in in the world and in part of the matter you get what you pay for we're gonna have national health insurance which seems likely it's necessarily gonna involve more taxes
Customer 29.862500 41.716125 uh i suspect they take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden
Customer 41.716125 46.987875 in various kinds of sales taxes uh
Customer 46.987875 56.558750 [noise] energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look
Customer 56.558750 60.714375 [silence]
Agent 56.654125 62.006375 right well i guess i kind of have mixed feelings [laughter]

Customer 85.805625 96.382500 well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going in[to]- into a big trust fund but

Customer 112.652875 124.117250 i think Senator Moynihan's proposal to to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense
