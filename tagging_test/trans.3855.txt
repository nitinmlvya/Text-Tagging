Agent 86.499750 88.879000 [laughter]

Agent 88.879000 97.889250 yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
Customer 89.966375 94.704000 [silence]
Customer 94.704000 96.300750 oh yeah

Customer 117.113750 122.424250 [silence]
Customer 122.424250 124.076250 uh-huh uh-huh
Agent 123.054250 133.801875 and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a l[ittle]- even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
Customer 124.076250 131.354750 [silence]
Customer 131.354750 133.222750 uh-huh uh-huh

Agent 133.801875 141.457250 [silence]
Customer 134.378375 144.031875 yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because y[ou]- there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket
Agent 141.457250 142.908750 oh yeah
Agent 142.908750 145.840375 [silence]

Agent 156.501000 157.951625 yeah
Agent 157.951625 168.823250 and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in
Customer 158.602250 175.989500 [silence]
Agent 168.823250 180.603250 and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt
Customer 175.989500 177.194875 right
Customer 177.194875 182.796000 [silence]
Agent 180.603250 183.787125 you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then

Customer 187.329375 189.375500 [silence]
Customer 189.375500 191.495125 yeah right
Agent 191.463000 195.763750 [silence]
Customer 191.495125 196.507125 and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything
Agent 195.763750 197.038250 i know
Customer 196.507125 206.304125 you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amou[nt]- i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you
Agent 197.038250 204.932500 [silence]
Agent 204.932500 206.803500 yeah exactly
Customer 206.304125 212.933125 you know so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know
Agent 206.803500 212.299500 [silence]
Agent 212.299500 216.884625 yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody
