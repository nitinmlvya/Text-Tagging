Agent 0.000000 1.499250 [noise] we're talking about taxes
Customer 0.000000 0.661500 [noise]
Customer 0.661500 5.429125 taxes right you thi[nk]- you think you pay too much
Agent 1.499250 3.257875 all right well you
Agent 3.257875 9.187125 [silence]
Customer 5.429125 9.214375 is what they said and do you think you'd get what you pay [laughter-for]
Agent 9.187125 19.550375 that's hard to say you know i think it take a lot for granted you know and it's th[e]- the quick answer i think would be that you pay too much taxes you know but but i think if you think about it
Customer 9.214375 16.433875 [silence]
Customer 16.433875 17.550875 yeah
Customer 17.550875 45.228125 [silence]
Agent 19.550375 26.590375 um all the highways we have all the uh federal programs we have whether they're good or bad um
Agent 26.590375 34.089875 sure seems like you do get a bang you know it seems like a lot of stuff's going on even though every paycheck a lot of money's coming out
Agent 34.089875 40.186500 um i don't know i don't know it seems like so i used to think that government spent too much and they probably do but
Agent 40.186500 48.498125 you know when you go to your doctor your doctor's private also and uh they're gonna charge you a good buck for whatever they're doing also so well what do you think
Customer 45.228125 47.409500 right
Customer 47.409500 56.749500 well i really feel in some areas that uh i agree i don't think any of us like paying taxes i think in some areas we could do better in a private sector
Agent 48.498125 87.683750 [silence]
Customer 56.749500 66.357500 i think it just i've done some reading on this and so[me]- and in some of the areas you know you're lucky to get back a a dime on a dollar on some programs
Customer 66.357500 77.888375 uh but i also know that people to me won't do what they should do to help each other and they wouldn't have so much government if we did
Customer 77.888375 89.076750 and uh we get you know gets forced into it i think socialized medicine's coming which i hate to see but i think because there's so many people without insurance that's what's c[oming]- you know it's coming
Agent 87.683750 89.824375 yeah it's needed
Customer 89.076750 90.534875 uh-huh
Agent 89.824375 100.049625 [silence]
Customer 90.534875 93.172000 so uh
Customer 93.172000 100.581500 but no i don't probably feel like i get back what i pay now you do you pay state income tax in
Agent 100.049625 104.166625 yeah i i pay actually state city and federal
Customer 100.581500 103.219250 [silence]
Customer 103.219250 112.448500 yeah see here a lot of people think in Texas we're lucky because_1 we don't pay um state income tax but they get us in other ways you know
Agent 104.166625 105.571125 and
Agent 105.571125 111.981625 [silence]
Agent 111.981625 124.080250 yeah well i i just figured it out today i get uh i think my my two week pay is sixteen hundred and eleven dollars or something like that sixteen sixteen something around there and my
Customer 112.448500 128.382000 [silence]
Agent 124.080250 129.458125 take home after taxes is about eleven
Customer 128.382000 131.337500 [noise] um yeah
Agent 129.458125 134.333375 so five hundred dollars every two weeks comes out you know and obviously if you make
Customer 131.337500 137.524625 [silence]
Agent 134.333375 143.581750 you know forty thousand dollars a year you're paying ten thousand in dollars a year in taxes and everybody who's in that type of income is paying that
Customer 137.524625 138.797750 yeah
Customer 138.797750 142.993250 [silence]
Customer 142.993250 145.783750 i think that's another problem
Agent 143.581750 147.444125 you know plus sales tax right [noise]
Customer 145.783750 153.788750 uh yeah well that's where they got us here you know every time they need something they up the quote user's fees or the sin taxes you know on beer and such
Agent 147.444125 152.261625 [noise]
Agent 152.261625 158.877875 sure sure and plus you pay if you buy cigarettes you pay tax on that if you buy beer
Customer 153.788750 155.817125 [silence]
Customer 155.817125 163.562500 yeah so just because we don't have a state income tax they get us proportionately higher in other areas
Agent 158.877875 163.226875 [noise]
Agent 163.226875 165.104625 yeah yeah
Customer 163.562500 164.583375 [silence]
Customer 164.583375 166.912500 so i don't know
Agent 165.104625 165.901250 you
Agent 165.901250 168.277000 you don't have a state income tax in Texas
Customer 166.912500 168.403375 no
Agent 168.277000 172.468375 that's so yeah that's not so bad but they still have to get the money somewhere to
Customer 168.403375 170.900625 [silence]
Customer 170.900625 177.502625 they get it somewhere and and the problem is with that if you have a state income tax you can take it off you federal
Agent 172.468375 173.835500 yeah
Agent 173.835500 197.814625 [silence]
Customer 177.502625 183.303750 so we can't take our any of our sales taxes or anything off anymore because of the reform
Customer 183.303750 190.900500 but that's what they up it they up it on gasoline they up it on um say beer and cigarettes uh
Customer 190.900500 197.498750 user's fee driver's license license plates it all just keeps going up and up and up and they tell us it's not really taxes
Customer 197.498750 200.538250 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-but]
Agent 197.814625 199.497000 [laughter-right]
Agent 199.497000 201.477000 [noise]
Customer 200.538250 207.011500 it is and uh no i don't know i don't know what the answer is to all this i think uh
Agent 201.477000 202.754500 same difference
Agent 202.754500 206.844750 [noise]
Agent 206.844750 207.949875 w[hat]-
Customer 207.011500 208.870500 i don't know
Agent 207.949875 213.847375 i- i think it's a i- i don't know i- i think i think it's like private like you said privatization is good because
Customer 208.870500 219.393375 [silence]
Agent 213.847375 227.762875 you know when the pr[ofit]- uh one good thing that could be said for the profit motive is people aren't going to run a business at a loss i happen to work for a city for the City of New York and uh that's the attitude that uh at least my agency takes
Customer 219.393375 220.589875 right
Customer 220.589875 231.819250 [silence]
Agent 227.762875 231.979500 you know they they w[hen]- they take the attitude that uh this is a business
Customer 231.819250 233.170625 right
Agent 231.979500 245.908125 and and if you're not going to run it profitably then you're going to be out of business because they are going to privatize it so in that sense you know at my agency a[nd]- and it's unique i think for government agencies is revenue producing
Customer 233.170625 245.155625 [silence]
Customer 245.155625 246.407625 right
Agent 245.908125 250.013500 and we make more money than we than we cost so uh
Customer 246.407625 248.763250 [silence]
Customer 248.763250 251.063125 well that's really unusual
Agent 250.013500 259.550000 so nobody's ever going to question my salary or anybody else on my staff uh especially my unit because my unit is a revenue producing unit uh there are other
Customer 251.063125 252.920625 [silence]
Customer 252.920625 254.099000 right
Customer 254.099000 273.136875 [silence]
Agent 259.550000 264.943250 you know things that that may i mean look at that i was talking to my father the other day about the NASA program
Agent 264.943250 276.992500 you know he thought it was kind of ridiculous we spend all this money to send these rocket ships up into space and stuff but yet then again they come up with all these scientific discoveries that may help save us sometime i mean i think it was NASA
Customer 273.136875 274.755375 right
Customer 274.755375 277.565125 that we've learned a lot
Agent 276.992500 283.055125 yeah you do learn a lot so you're not you you know you're paying all this money but you're getting something back for it uh
Customer 277.565125 281.501750 [silence]
Customer 281.501750 282.756750 yeah
Customer 282.756750 293.446250 [silence]
Agent 283.055125 291.461875 you know military spending is the same thing whether you agree or you disagree with building all these bombs and stuff which i happen to have a tendency to disagree with
Agent 291.461875 299.298000 uh you know we are buying protection you know we are protecting ourselves from from uh from other countries that we may be afraid of whether it's right
Customer 293.446250 294.743500 yeah
Customer 294.743500 298.738125 [silence]
Customer 298.738125 299.298000 [noise]
