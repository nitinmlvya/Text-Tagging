Agent 0.000000 0.476500 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.880000 [noise]
Agent 0.476500 13.772750 [silence]
Customer 0.880000 10.214250 first and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two percent straight across the board cut in federal spending in all departments
Customer 10.214250 15.911750 [silence]
Agent 13.772750 16.020375 now dealing on the federal level
Customer 15.911750 17.525375 yes
Agent 16.020375 28.697125 two perc[ent]- two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder
Customer 17.525375 43.407500 [silence]
Agent 28.697125 43.099875 where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because_1 they're actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product
Agent 43.099875 46.400875 or their or their
Customer 43.407500 47.997875 gross national product or profit okay
Agent 46.400875 47.900500 profit rather
Agent 47.900500 53.375250 [noise]
Customer 47.997875 53.444500 i'm not knowledgeable in that area so i can only agree with what you're saying
Agent 53.375250 58.020375 if they made it straight across the board everybody pay five percent
Customer 53.444500 69.957875 [silence]
Agent 58.020375 59.872375 if their gross
Agent 59.872375 62.193250 national profit
Agent 62.193250 63.529000 was
Agent 63.529000 66.210250 [silence]
Agent 66.210250 70.310250 say a million dollars then pay five five percent of that
Customer 69.957875 71.270125 um-hum
Agent 70.310250 79.437000 [silence]
Customer 71.270125 76.185000 seems fair to me [laughter] also individual level
Customer 76.185000 101.927500 [silence]
Agent 79.437000 80.866500 but the um
Agent 80.866500 85.056250 [silence]
Agent 85.056250 94.987500 overall it just seem like they've modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is it's definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people
Agent 94.987500 97.651625 middle class and
Agent 97.651625 103.441375 you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden
Customer 101.927500 103.501375 um-hum
Agent 103.441375 174.652500 [silence]
Customer 103.501375 108.416875 well i am awfully bored with uh every
Customer 108.416875 117.424875 every tax change uh supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor because
Customer 117.424875 126.070000 i think we have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor so much graft
Customer 126.070000 134.115500 and so much misspending that that money doesn't necessarily go where it's supposed to go
Customer 134.115500 142.103000 uh i know you don't ever cutout greed and corruption but i think the management of the
Customer 142.103000 155.238750 welfare dollar needs to come back t[o]- to the local levels because the local people know exactly who needs that money and who doesn't need that money when it's directed from afar
Customer 155.238750 159.930250 i think the chance for misspending is greater
Customer 159.930250 168.339375 i i suppose i'm thinking more in terms i i'm not thinking in terms of increasing taxes i'm just thinking for a quick fix
Customer 168.339375 174.270000 uh a cut in federal spending is i guess my solution
Customer 174.270000 183.661125 [silence]
Agent 174.652500 178.699750 as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kick[backs]-
Agent 178.699750 183.922250 kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts that's never going to happen
Customer 183.661125 193.400875 i know [laughter] that's well maybe that's what i'm saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though
Agent 183.922250 197.760875 [silence]
Customer 193.400875 209.577875 [silence]
Agent 197.760875 200.250250 the one thing that i
Agent 200.250250 202.200500 had thought about
Agent 202.200500 203.633750 [silence]
Agent 203.633750 210.735000 to help correct that problem you've got career politicians that spend thirty forty years in Washington that's all they have ever done
Customer 209.577875 210.628875 right
Customer 210.628875 215.994000 [silence]
Agent 210.735000 216.784625 after they've been there that long they're so deep rooted with their the old boy network
Customer 215.994000 217.012125 um-hum
Agent 216.784625 217.918875 [silence]
Customer 217.012125 226.021875 [silence]
Agent 217.918875 224.422250 i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman
Agent 224.422250 228.677375 or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then they've got to sit out one
Customer 226.021875 226.953250 um-hum
Customer 226.953250 229.697250 [silence]
Agent 228.677375 238.257750 [silence]
Customer 229.697250 238.387500 i think that's wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income as a retired politician
Agent 238.257750 240.776375 i don't think we should ever give them_1 a lifetime income
Customer 238.387500 240.569000 [silence]
Customer 240.569000 241.996750 but we do don't we
Agent 240.776375 242.366750 [silence]
Customer 241.996750 243.279500 [silence]
Agent 242.366750 243.485375 unfortunately
Customer 243.279500 250.446750 [laughter-yes] i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you
Agent 243.485375 269.644500 [silence]
Customer 250.446750 264.629625 uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous there's they have locked their benefits in to the point that once they've served two terms they're on gravy train anyway
Customer 264.629625 268.886875 yes i think you're right i don't think we should ever give them_1 a lifetime thing
Customer 268.886875 280.870625 [silence]
Agent 269.644500 274.047375 and they're the ones that have screamed so mu[ch]- m[uch]- much about
Agent 274.047375 280.983250 that don't want to increase taxes and they don't want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise
Customer 280.870625 286.884000 it they don't they speak with fork and tongue don't [laughter-they]
Agent 280.983250 300.295125 [silence]
Customer 286.884000 299.558750 at least we're in agreement on that aren't we [laughter] i'm afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and i'm not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow
Customer 299.558750 316.407875 [silence]
Agent 300.295125 303.230250 i th[ink]- eventually it's going get to the point where
Agent 303.230250 307.227250 there's going to be a majority of the American people that have had enough of what it's
Agent 307.227250 309.387250 finally come to we're
Agent 309.387250 312.256875 you getting so far down to where
Agent 312.256875 317.040250 you're being taxed so far down where you can't even afford to change your mind
Customer 316.407875 317.444375 um-hum
Agent 317.040250 320.995000 it's going to come to a point where the average American citizens say we've had enough
Customer 317.444375 322.265375 [silence]
Agent 320.995000 342.502375 [silence]
Customer 322.265375 324.268000 how do they react then
Customer 324.268000 326.670875 [silence]
Customer 326.670875 336.870375 we're prosecuted if we simply don't pay our taxes so i'm not real sure how you believe then that eventually there'll be an overthrow
Customer 336.870375 341.112250 we know communism doesn't work what do we do next
Customer 341.112250 349.075625 [silence]
Agent 342.502375 347.994000 well in the form of capitalism that we've got apparently that's not working real good either
Agent 347.994000 397.773875 [silence]
Customer 349.075625 360.618375 uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority say[ing]- speaking on TV saying that the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the
Customer 360.618375 372.487250 that high again and he was speaking in senior citizens living on their incomes of from interest CD interest and that sort of interest i think
Customer 372.487250 380.730750 the voting block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block too but every voting block is
Customer 380.730750 390.017250 slapped and toward their own special interest and i think that makes it doubly difficult to make a change i guess i'm saying we're all selfish
Customer 390.017250 404.529625 [silence]
Agent 397.773875 400.841500 maybe not a case of everybody being selfish
Agent 400.841500 404.818125 every man carry their own fair burden but not somebody else's
Customer 404.529625 406.405250 yes that's true
Agent 404.818125 443.337750 [silence]
Customer 406.405250 408.045625 [silence]
Customer 408.045625 414.621750 it doesn't seem to workout that way [laughter-though] [laughter-does] [laughter-it] i think that the lobbyist uh
Customer 414.621750 416.138500 [silence]
Customer 416.138500 426.066375 are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're doing
Customer 426.066375 428.649875 because of the kickbacks and et cetera
Customer 428.649875 430.020750 [silence]
Customer 430.020750 435.543000 i'm a bit of a a pessimist i don't see a change in my lifetime i'm afraid
Customer 435.543000 439.485750 [silence]
Customer 439.485750 442.124500 you're younger perhaps you can foresee one
Customer 442.124500 451.890750 [silence]
Agent 443.337750 445.617750 i never put anything beyond
Agent 445.617750 446.833750 [silence]
Agent 446.833750 449.030500 as far as when it'll happen
Agent 449.030500 450.398875 [silence]
Agent 450.398875 454.522750 that i'm not real sure of if it will happen i have no doubt
Customer 451.890750 452.741375 um-hum
Customer 452.741375 454.033750 [silence]
Customer 454.033750 455.100500 um-hum
Agent 454.522750 481.097875 [silence]
Customer 455.100500 464.981125 yes i think you're right i'm just saying that i don't think the American people are at this point rebellious enough that it will happen in my lifetime
Customer 464.981125 470.850125 yes i think eventually the system will change i still think we have the best system
Customer 470.850125 475.725250 uh with the elected officials i i'm not sure that uh
Customer 475.725250 478.292500 it's working right now though
Customer 478.292500 485.784375 [silence]
Agent 481.097875 487.827375 it is the best system that's out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point
Customer 485.784375 489.810500 absolutely [laughter] nice talking to you
Agent 487.827375 489.016000 [silence]
