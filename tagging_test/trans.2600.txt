Agent 142.955750 144.897125 and then you can't draw it
Customer 144.543500 152.310625 that's right and then and then you start drawing your retirement pay and if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for dollar
Agent 144.897125 151.857750 [silence]

Customer 396.491375 398.350000 it is i mean
Customer 398.350000 403.541625 i'm one of those forty million Americans running around with no health insurance at the moment
Agent 399.113125 403.965125 [silence]
Customer 403.541625 423.523875 [silence]
Agent 403.965125 412.764875 in our state currently when in Colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax
Agent 412.764875 417.935125 they ask you if you have medical insurance if you do
Agent 417.935125 422.682750 you have to pay for those that don't have medical insurance
Agent 422.682750 423.980500 [silence]
Customer 423.523875 424.771875 huh
Agent 423.980500 429.475250 i think it's two or four dollars a person i don't remember something along those lines but it
Customer 424.771875 430.609625 [silence]
Agent 429.475250 431.888625 still the idea irks me so that
Customer 430.609625 432.030000 yeah
Agent 431.888625 454.948750 [silence]
Customer 432.030000 439.143750 well it's sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax uh they create
Customer 439.143750 440.311250 money
Customer 440.311250 443.421625 to tax you with or to tax you on
Customer 443.421625 446.802875 there's a neat little formula on the back that you have to complete
Customer 446.802875 459.389625 and assuming you're you're you're at poverty line where you're uh deduction or you take the standard deduction of thirty two fifty uh that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars
Agent 454.948750 456.016500 right
Agent 456.016500 462.715125 [silence]
Customer 459.389625 462.584625 tacked on to your taxable income
Customer 462.584625 467.274875 yeah and of course it goes higher and higher the more money you make
Agent 462.715125 463.858000 oh no
Agent 463.858000 474.172875 [silence]
Customer 467.274875 476.685125 but the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is three hundred dollars and they create money out of thin air
Agent 474.172875 474.960125 huh
Agent 474.960125 487.143625 [silence]
Customer 476.685125 484.474750 i wr[ote]- i- i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying gee i didn't know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went
Customer 484.474750 499.982625 [silence]
Agent 487.143625 491.099750 uh Colorado is a nifty thing if you
Agent 491.099750 494.589500 or they did until last year
