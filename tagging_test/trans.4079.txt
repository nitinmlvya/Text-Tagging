Agent 67.172250 68.378375 uh-huh
Customer 67.502125 74.555250 and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it

Customer 74.555250 112.339000 [silence]
Agent 75.136500 76.489250 [silence]
Agent 76.489250 86.936500 well i found that uh you know thing[s]- as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to v[ery]- have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh
Agent 86.936500 95.268250 you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and
Agent 95.268250 109.240750 uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know -[w]ill come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance
Agent 109.240750 121.594500 uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but
Customer 112.339000 113.629375 um-hum
Customer 113.629375 131.414875 [silence]
Agent 121.594500 132.006375 what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total
Customer 131.414875 132.534875 um-hum
Agent 132.006375 140.172875 and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside
Customer 132.534875 139.222500 [silence]
Customer 139.222500 140.470125 right
Agent 140.172875 142.497875 and i guess that's a way of budgeting
Customer 140.470125 141.928500 [silence]
Customer 141.928500 143.472750 yeah that's
Agent 142.497875 153.824625 [silence]
Customer 143.472750 148.393000 i guess i kind of do a similar thing more m[edium]- uh medium or longer range i just have a
Customer 148.393000 154.499625 maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car
