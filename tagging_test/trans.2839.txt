Agent 1.627375 10.190875 ye[s]- yes i think we're terribly taxed i- i think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats and i don't think there's a change between one party than the other uh
Customer 2.346500 15.392500 [silence]

Agent 14.562375 26.794625 [silence]
Customer 15.392500 25.490500 uh i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt
Customer 25.490500 38.965125 instead of using the money for where it ought to go it it's just it's ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into ac[tion]- action the the G[ramm]- the G[ramm]- Rud[man]- what is it
Agent 26.794625 28.204750 right
Agent 28.204750 42.354500 [silence]
Customer 38.965125 51.315875 uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that why did they do that that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together
Agent 42.354500 44.952125 the Gramm the Gramm Rudman Act yeah
Agent 44.952125 50.846625 [silence]

Customer 51.315875 55.065375 [silence]
Customer 55.065375 57.519125 oh yeah i think so too
Agent 56.443750 64.045875 a lot of the the taxes gets back to the the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years rather than
Customer 57.519125 61.897250 [silence]
Customer 61.897250 75.194750 yeah well things like mailings they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things they just think once they get there that they can do just anything you know they don't they don't try to uh to conserve
Agent 64.045875 72.601500 [silence]
Agent 72.601500 74.451250 no you're right
Agent 74.451250 81.317250 [silence]
Customer 75.194750 81.665375 and of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving and i mean when i don't have money i don't buy something
Agent 81.317250 87.692750 yeah no i think uh it it is the the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money uh
Customer 81.665375 86.778625 [silence]
Customer 86.778625 89.205875 they sure don't seem to
Agent 87.692750 90.776000 the national debt is terrible uh
Customer 89.205875 90.488000 [silence]
Customer 90.488000 100.376375 there're a couple of things i think we need to really work for and i don't know quite how to do it but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto
Agent 90.776000 104.855125 [silence]
Customer 100.376375 106.726500 so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything if it's a good idea it can be done again
Agent 104.855125 106.420750 right
Agent 106.420750 108.295625 oh yeah
Customer 106.726500 113.786125 you know and if it's not so what at least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months
Agent 108.295625 113.452125 [silence]
Agent 113.452125 122.950000 yeah i saw one on Twenty Twenty uh about a month ago i guess whereas one i think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that maybe it was
Customer 113.786125 145.059875 [silence]
Agent 122.950000 125.980625 uh Connecticut i'm not sure one of the small states up there
Agent 125.980625 130.895875 where he had a bill through for another um
Agent 130.895875 136.346125 a drug agency that would be located there and he was the only one that wanted it
Agent 136.346125 139.761375 it was going to cost millions of dollars the drug agency didn't want it
Agent 139.761375 144.769500 and he was going to build it in his home town and they were going to hire a lot of people
Agent 144.769500 145.513750 [silence]
Customer 145.059875 146.576125 [laughter]
Agent 145.513750 149.481625 and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing and and you know they they asked him about it and
Customer 146.576125 149.218750 yeah this is that's right
Customer 149.218750 154.251750 [silence]
Agent 149.481625 155.066375 do you really need this this is going to cost a lot of money oh yes we need it but do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this
Customer 154.251750 156.132500 yeah
Agent 155.066375 158.255000 and they do things that are you know just like the uh
Customer 156.132500 156.967250 [silence]
Customer 156.967250 166.548750 yeah that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on and the trouble is you don't you have so little input about it you don't know enough
Agent 158.255000 160.034625 [silence]
Agent 160.034625 161.471375 yeah that
Agent 161.471375 164.989875 [silence]
Agent 164.989875 166.572250 right
Customer 166.548750 170.854875 to know what what to do about some of this stuff i
Agent 166.572250 169.228875 [silence]
Agent 169.228875 173.834000 right yeah they're supposed to do what we say but they do what they they want to do really
Customer 170.854875 172.394375 [silence]
Customer 172.394375 182.768750 yeah that's right the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good i- i just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got
Agent 173.834000 178.517500 [silence]
Agent 178.517500 180.585250 absolutely absolutely
Agent 180.585250 182.228375 [silence]
Agent 182.228375 189.622625 we need to get that through we we have said that i've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea[r]- two terms is enough for all of them
Customer 182.768750 189.548875 [silence]
Customer 189.548875 190.806125 yeah
Agent 189.622625 198.035625 uh whether you're mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly President that uh two terms is plenty
Customer 190.806125 197.381125 [silence]
Customer 197.381125 199.488000 yeah i think that's right
Agent 198.035625 205.607250 and then we get these professionals out of there and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than living off of us
Customer 199.488000 202.971500 [silence]
Customer 202.971500 204.509625 yeah wouldn't that be too bad
Customer 204.509625 205.602375 [laughter]
Customer 205.602375 209.945375 well that's right i think i don't know i think uh
Agent 205.607250 218.435625 [silence]
Customer 209.945375 212.382625 people in general the the the
Customer 212.382625 222.730875 the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly you know it starts at the courts it starts everywhere
Agent 218.435625 219.891500 um-hum
Agent 219.891500 222.070750 [silence]
Agent 222.070750 224.036000 right
Customer 222.730875 230.500750 until we can't we've just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know
Agent 224.036000 230.153125 [silence]
Agent 230.153125 234.980500 well it's so much money and you can't even add it up you know that's why they think it's [vocalized-noise]
Customer 230.500750 232.245125 [silence]
Customer 232.245125 236.090125 no you can't even can't even conceive of what they're talking about
Agent 234.980500 241.313375 yeah when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know
Customer 236.090125 237.795750 [silence]

Agent 241.313375 252.819625 [silence]
Customer 243.438500 250.428625 the other thing is it's it's all very well to give money to help people other people and i think we need to do that
Customer 250.428625 255.205500 but there are they need to put more limits on them they need to restrain about what they do
Agent 252.819625 254.806250 foreign aid yeah
Agent 254.806250 261.717500 foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely necessary they they've given that away for fifty years
Customer 255.205500 257.202625 [silence]
Customer 257.202625 258.683000 yeah
Customer 258.683000 266.835250 i- i you know i think that's probably un[less]- unless we can afford it if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again
Agent 261.717500 265.900625 [silence]
Agent 265.900625 267.494375 i agree i agree
Customer 266.835250 275.614625 you know i don't really mind helping people but you you need to get rid of this thing that's that's just uh eating us up
Agent 267.494375 274.776500 [silence]
Agent 274.776500 276.745625 um-hum
Customer 275.614625 282.944500 you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the
Agent 276.745625 284.610875 [silence]
Customer 282.944500 285.352250 the magistrate [laughter]
Agent 284.610875 285.893625 right
Customer 285.352250 291.021250 for for doing all these wicked things you know but the government does it and it's all right
Agent 285.893625 289.983375 [silence]
Agent 289.983375 295.413500 yeah i- i know we're taxed to death on every every thing i don't know what's the best way to do it but uh
Customer 291.021250 298.407500 [silence]
Agent 295.413500 301.260000 they don't even talk about that they just raise it they don't even consider it like you saying is to cut something back you know
Customer 298.407500 300.293000 yeah that's true
Customer 300.293000 301.703125 [silence]
Agent 301.260000 302.129125 [silence]
Customer 301.703125 303.037000 well sounds like
Agent 302.129125 310.357875 they are at least doing something now with the uh the military you know they're cutting some of that but of course now you know TI you know that's hurting us but although
Customer 303.037000 308.475500 [silence]
Customer 308.475500 311.912375 yeah it's good to see them_1 doing some things there anyway
Agent 310.357875 311.943250 [silence]
Customer 311.912375 317.924375 [silence]
Agent 311.943250 320.727875 TI has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic uh weapon systems but uh
Customer 317.924375 320.032750 yeah
Customer 320.032750 323.319625 [silence]
Agent 320.727875 328.902375 that's the only good that i've seen Congress do you know and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody uh
Customer 323.319625 325.654875 well
Customer 325.654875 326.724625 [silence]
Customer 326.724625 338.810625 i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens we're going to have to bite the bullet and we're all going to have to do it i it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere
Agent 328.902375 337.746375 [silence]
Agent 337.746375 339.498250 yeah yeah
Customer 338.810625 348.517250 that's why i thought well you know this is the time they need to put that into act[ion]- into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut they've got to cut costs
Agent 339.498250 347.812875 [silence]
Agent 347.812875 352.113125 yeah the only taxes i think that are well spent well not the only but uh
Customer 348.517250 368.148500 [silence]
Agent 352.113125 356.558750 i think the now i- i don't understand the present school thing but uh
Agent 356.558750 361.657625 i have two daughters one's in college already and one's about uh to be in high school but uh
Agent 361.657625 370.598125 i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know
Customer 368.148500 370.457250 yeah i think that's right
Customer 370.457250 377.634750 well i don't i don't really mind paying taxes for for positive things
Agent 370.598125 379.639000 [silence]
Customer 377.634750 387.435375 that are helps like roads and making sure that uh that water is safe and some of these things but um
Agent 379.639000 381.684375 yeah
Agent 381.684375 392.181000 [silence]
Customer 387.435375 388.621125 [silence]
Customer 388.621125 402.584875 you know it you just feel like it's out of control you feel like they do not have control of it and that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think i could spend my money i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing
Agent 392.181000 393.448875 yeah
Agent 393.448875 395.345125 the spending is out of control
Agent 395.345125 401.636375 [silence]
Agent 401.636375 403.240875 yeah oh i agree with you
Customer 402.584875 404.015875 so it's
Agent 403.240875 409.417750 i- i think that's a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh
Customer 404.015875 404.924500 [silence]
Customer 404.924500 406.671500 yeah
Customer 406.671500 409.297375 [silence]
Customer 409.297375 416.535250 well i think that's right if they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start doing something i think they're really going to have to i think
Agent 409.417750 416.002750 [silence]
Agent 416.002750 421.002125 i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that
Customer 416.535250 433.117625 [silence]
Agent 421.002125 427.509000 what they did last election and uh ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in you know so
Agent 427.509000 430.619875 we need to try to get people to two terms so they
Agent 430.619875 435.164125 respect our wishes you know they're supposed to represent us that's what they're called but they don't
Customer 433.117625 435.304250 yeah yeah
Agent 435.164125 440.701375 may[be]- may[be]- maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are
Customer 435.304250 441.066000 [silence]
Agent 440.701375 446.155500 [silence]
Customer 441.066000 446.574625 yeah in some ways we're awful lucky i guess there a lot of lot of places where it's worse than it is here but
Agent 446.155500 448.085875 i know but it
Customer 446.574625 450.049875 still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens
Agent 448.085875 453.431125 no that's right you don't want to uh you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be
Customer 450.049875 459.384000 no we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and and i guess in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes
Agent 453.431125 466.504500 [silence]
Customer 459.384000 468.595125 but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent that they're doing something that's positive for for somebody
Agent 466.504500 467.748750 right
Agent 467.748750 475.111125 [silence]
Customer 468.595125 471.681250 i don't really feel like uh
Customer 471.681250 481.588875 i don't really feel like i use taxes [laughter-very] [laughter-much] [laughter-i] don't know maybe i do more than i- i guess i do i use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh
Agent 475.111125 477.050125 yeah that's you're right
Agent 477.050125 480.880000 [silence]
Agent 480.880000 486.291375 well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex uh in the last say twenty five years or so maybe longer
Customer 481.588875 495.832625 [silence]
Agent 486.291375 496.106625 they've built all these dams you know the Corps of Engineers have uh soon as they finish a lake they'll go at get another one and that we haven't had uh we've had droughts here in long summers
Customer 495.832625 497.309000 yeah
Agent 496.106625 503.818000 we've had good water supply and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know
Customer 497.309000 502.010875 [silence]
Customer 502.010875 509.310750 yeah they've done some good things the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago

Customer 516.789500 519.463375 [silence]
Customer 519.463375 520.743625 yeah
Customer 520.743625 529.410875 yeah there are a lot of p[laces]- places where they're in real trouble and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take if they don't take that early stand
Agent 521.922625 523.305375 [silence]
Agent 523.305375 525.554000 right

Customer 529.410875 534.971000 [silence]
Customer 534.971000 536.845250 yeah that's probably right
Customer 536.845250 543.306625 the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait -[un]til something -[un]til they need them_1
Agent 537.130250 541.543750 [silence]
Agent 541.543750 542.793500 right
