Customer 33.223500 35.168750 [noise]
Agent 34.692000 35.630625 [noise]
Customer 35.168750 38.534875 uh i love the irony of uh
Agent 35.630625 50.301875 [silence]
Customer 38.534875 42.303000 talking about this subject on April the fifteenth
Customer 42.303000 50.108375 but um i'm afraid i'm i['m]- i'm probably in the minority i- i actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country
Customer 50.108375 56.997125 um um particularly uh in this part of the country wh[ere]- um i guess
Agent 50.301875 52.130875 i agree with you
Agent 52.130875 81.282625 [silence]
Customer 56.997125 62.653250 i do have a uh a bone to pick with um uh the way taxes are distributed
Customer 62.653250 73.149875 um i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal form
Customer 73.149875 77.758000 and the sales tax can't i think that's regressive and uh
Customer 77.758000 79.319750 um
Customer 79.319750 81.152500 it's kind of dumb
Customer 81.152500 89.878875 [silence]
Agent 81.282625 85.903500 i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax but then on the other hand i don't mind that it's only on
Agent 85.903500 87.988500 you know things that aren't
Agent 87.988500 90.426125 like [noise] groceries and that it's not on them
Customer 89.878875 94.364250 well i mean nobody taxes groceries do they where
Agent 90.426125 91.689750 [silence]
Agent 91.689750 94.032375 oh yeah they do
Agent 94.032375 95.511125 in Arizona
Customer 94.364250 96.381125 is that right
Agent 95.511125 96.621500 um-hum
Customer 96.381125 98.007000 [noise]
Agent 96.621500 97.655500 [silence]
Agent 97.655500 103.852125 we have a pretty low income ta[x]- i mean pretty low tax rate here oh i think tha[t]- the sales tax they just got to do something about it
Customer 98.007000 103.144125 [silence]
Customer 103.144125 104.888500 right it's
Agent 103.852125 108.037500 but that's the {politicalness} of trying to not create any new taxes
Customer 104.888500 107.426750 [silence]
Customer 107.426750 109.071125 right [noise]
Agent 108.037500 136.586125 [silence]
Customer 109.071125 117.665750 but i guess when i hear whe[n]- when i see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country
Customer 117.665750 124.893250 uh their their rates are like uh forty one forty two and ours are like thirty six thirty seven
Customer 124.893250 132.498125 you know if you compute it as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well
Customer 132.498125 136.943000 th[ere's]- th[ere's]- there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are
Agent 136.586125 145.508500 well and i still think having lived in Europe for awhile you know [noise] the difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it
Customer 136.943000 141.072500 [silence]
Customer 141.072500 142.305500 yeah
Customer 142.305500 145.043875 [silence]
Customer 145.043875 146.547125 uh-huh
Agent 145.508500 149.039250 [silence]
Customer 146.547125 149.301000 i'm i'm not sure i understand what you mean
Agent 149.039250 152.870375 well i mean i think i was in Germany you know for several years
Customer 149.301000 151.994000 [silence]
Customer 151.994000 153.245250 right
Agent 152.870375 158.927875 [noise] and i'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have than have to live there
Customer 153.245250 158.072250 [silence]
Customer 158.072250 169.673375 [noise] oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of low[er]- higher uh yeah i suppose that's true yeah um probably mo[re]- less so now than it was ten years ago or whenever but
Agent 158.927875 160.870750 [silence]
Agent 160.870750 163.402125 higher taxes yeah
Agent 163.402125 168.777125 [silence]
Agent 168.777125 171.562250 still is that way to some extent
Customer 169.673375 170.805250 [noise]
Customer 170.805250 172.025750 yeah
Agent 171.562250 180.209125 [noise] i think the other problem is you know it's it's easy to complain about taxes because they're something you theoretically can do something about
Customer 172.025750 179.595625 [silence]
Customer 179.595625 180.820500 right
Agent 180.209125 193.521000 but i look for example and you you're not in the quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world i wish i didn't have to pay [noise] any more fo[r]- fo[r]- to my physicians in a year than i had to pay for all of my school taxes
Customer 180.820500 184.794000 [silence]
Customer 184.794000 185.994875 right
Customer 185.994875 190.013750 [silence]
Customer 190.013750 191.219375 right
Customer 191.219375 192.593625 [silence]
Customer 192.593625 193.810000 yeah
Agent 193.521000 198.402000 [silence]
Customer 193.810000 195.771000 yeah since uh
Customer 195.771000 199.961875 i send my kids to parochial school that's uh
Agent 198.402000 201.162000 yeah that that's probably a little tougher on you
Customer 199.961875 205.328375 it's not it's not quite the bargain that [laughter-a] [laughter-guy] [laughter-would] [laughter-think] [noise]
Agent 201.162000 205.841250 [laughter]
Customer 205.328375 211.935000 but i mean i pay them gladly that's a decision i think it's a dumb decision on our part because
Agent 205.841250 238.589500 [silence]
Customer 211.935000 221.650125 countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money
Customer 221.650125 226.846250 but uh i mean that's uh that's the way the Americans want to interpret it i guess that's all right
Customer 226.846250 239.470750 but yeah i and if i were uh when i was single and again when i'm retired i will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good that's always been a high priority you know
Agent 238.589500 240.674875 no i think that's just you though
Customer 239.470750 240.889500 [noise]
Agent 240.674875 241.986250 [silence]
Customer 240.889500 249.207750 i do thi[nk]- yeah that's true i think in places i think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off
Agent 241.986250 244.032750 [laughter]
Agent 244.032750 262.612000 [silence]
Customer 249.207750 263.711000 if you add the um uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun the[y]- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get the tax bill passed no matter what happens
Agent 262.612000 263.843750 yeah
Customer 263.711000 272.321375 and uh [noise] there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done
Agent 263.843750 280.189250 [silence]
Customer 272.321375 273.800750 that seems um
Customer 273.800750 279.515750 um like a cultural lapse i mean people were always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they
Customer 279.515750 283.630250 [silence]
Agent 280.189250 284.778250 of course i think with the graying of America we're gonna see that problem in lots of places
Customer 283.630250 291.661250 right yeah people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools [laughter] because_1 it means more to them
Agent 284.778250 292.578750 [silence]
Customer 291.661250 293.615875 but i think it's sad
Agent 292.578750 294.846875 or build roads
Customer 293.615875 296.675250 selfish and shortsighted yeah
Agent 294.846875 298.946000 [silence]
Customer 296.675250 298.171375 well
Customer 298.171375 298.946000 uh
