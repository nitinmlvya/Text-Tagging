Customer 17.419875 41.458500 [silence]
Agent 19.315625 28.727250 it's funny that uh that you mention that because health care benefits are really a big issue nowadays because of the skyrocketing costs

Agent 31.838375 38.832125 we we have a choice between an H[MOs]- between various HMOs or just straight uh straight off major medical Blue Cross Blue Shield
Agent 38.832125 40.557000 and um
Agent 40.557000 50.777750 seems like the main idea of insurance companies is to try as hard as possible to deny benefits and collect uh premiums as much as possible
Customer 41.458500 42.932375 [noise]
Customer 42.932375 50.702000 [silence]
Customer 50.702000 60.667000 yeah yeah i- i i agree uh y[ou]- you pay a lot of money into them_1 and then when you finally do have a claim they uh they really stick it to you they say that it doesn't meet their uh
Agent 50.777750 52.014875 they're
Agent 52.014875 74.214625 [silence]
Customer 60.667000 74.485250 you know their their minimum amounts or something like that they've always got these uh these plans set up where they they've got a certain amount benchmarked for like a certain operation or something but when you go to that doctor it's always like ten or fifteen dollars more than what they'll pay for
Agent 74.214625 75.975750 yeah
Customer 74.485250 78.623750 and uh that's one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh
Agent 75.975750 90.395750 [silence]
Customer 78.623750 86.443625 the the pri[mary]- or the the customary fee should be fifty dollars but then the most of the doctors around here charge seventy five so it doesn't really keep up with what they
Customer 86.443625 88.450875 actually have so it's kind of a
Customer 88.450875 92.088750 they [vocalized-noise] they kind of take from you a little bit there and uh the uh
Agent 90.395750 92.626375 yeah absolutely

Agent 92.626375 109.650625 [silence]
Customer 99.247625 110.248750 and since then you know they've for the st[aggering]- skyrocketing uh medical costs like you've said uh they've really had to cut back on what they give people because it was just taking too much money out of the company
Agent 109.650625 115.909250 yeah it's expensive uh it's very expensive for the company to uh to pay all the benefits out uh
Customer 110.248750 121.685625 [silence]
