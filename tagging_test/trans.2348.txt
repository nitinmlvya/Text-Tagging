Customer 196.807125 208.439375 [silence]
Agent 197.077125 211.098125 oh that's sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then we've got that little cushion in there that
Customer 208.439375 209.659875 right
Customer 209.659875 215.177750 [silence]
Agent 211.098125 215.926375 you know will either cover it or partially so you know depending on what it is
Customer 215.177750 226.303875 yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um

Agent 234.734375 243.064625 uh [vocalized-noise] i i sort of feel like if you leave it there and you don't use it and you sort of don't see it then it's it's safe in a [laughter-sense]
Customer 235.085000 242.465250 [silence]
Customer 242.465250 250.075125 right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and they'll say you know well you've got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever
Agent 243.064625 249.518375 [silence]
Agent 249.518375 250.409500 yeah
Customer 250.075125 253.287875 but yeah it's it's it's kind of forced on you
Agent 250.409500 255.470375 [silence]
Customer 253.287875 255.778750 because you suffer a penalty
Agent 255.470375 256.473125 yeah

Agent 285.525500 290.813250 [silence]
Customer 285.861625 294.476125 but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers
Agent 290.813250 291.785125 yeah
Agent 291.785125 300.399000 [silence]
Customer 294.476125 298.878500 steam or momentum and you don't realize it you know it just
Customer 298.878500 300.560750 piles up
Agent 300.399000 309.089875 yeah that's a good deal well when you did keep a a budget all the time how strictly did you do that i mean was it real precise or

Agent 339.648125 340.815500 uh-huh
Agent 340.815500 347.141375 [silence]
Customer 341.387000 347.880375 we they put us on a budget they would run like uh [vocalized-noise] they could really tell how much oil you were going to use
Agent 347.141375 348.172750 uh-huh
Customer 347.880375 350.903250 so they budgeted it at year round
Agent 348.172750 359.074750 [silence]
Customer 350.903250 353.103125 so in the summer time
Customer 353.103125 355.723875 which you didn't use very little oil
Customer 355.723875 361.512000 you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when you're using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out
Agent 359.074750 360.023250 yeah
Agent 360.023250 378.800375 [silence]
Customer 361.512000 363.229000 and
Customer 363.229000 370.376875 we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didn't go out to eat that often
Customer 370.376875 379.305625 but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it
Agent 378.800375 379.947125 yeah
Customer 379.305625 381.091375 it it became a chore
Agent 379.947125 381.293375 [silence]
Customer 381.091375 384.826250 [silence]
Agent 381.293375 384.735250 well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that
Agent 384.735250 391.914000 [silence]
Customer 384.826250 387.201625 yeah i talked to to uh

Agent 399.207500 400.838250 yeah
Customer 399.779375 404.466375 and at the end of the month hopefully everything came out pretty close
Agent 400.838250 420.289500 [silence]
Customer 404.466375 409.460750 so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries
Customer 409.460750 416.327375 um but even at that point you know she'd say oh you know we we need this or the budget's not doing this or that uh
Customer 416.327375 421.578750 course me i didn't run it like she ran it like you run it now
Agent 420.289500 423.226875 [laughter] we[ll]-
Customer 421.578750 422.585125 [silence]
Customer 422.585125 426.431000 and it's pretty much the same she still does the same thing everything's fixed

Agent 441.251000 453.631625 [silence]

Customer 504.925500 510.262500 um it looks like we're probably going towards a cashless society
Agent 509.815000 512.303625 yeah to some extent i guess so
Customer 510.262500 511.992375 [silence]
Customer 511.992375 514.317125 because if you're doing that
Agent 512.303625 530.201500 [silence]
Customer 514.317125 518.956750 you know and i'm sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas
Customer 518.956750 530.460000 um and we're doing it m[ost]- most of the people up here that work ha[ve]- already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their banks or the credit union if they belong to the credit union
