Agent 84.284250 91.252750 and so that's pretty good y[ou]- it would probably be hard to have something like that in another type of job
Customer 90.986625 98.275625 so you like ha[ving]- having the flexibility to be able to take off time when you want to that's important to you
Agent 91.252750 95.859250 [silence]
Agent 95.859250 109.839000 oh yeah besides just s[ome]- besides some semester breaks th[e]- there is also other um [noise] other times too um [noise] like during the summer and things like that
Customer 98.275625 108.981000 [silence]
Customer 108.981000 120.497000 does uh recognition from others and a sense of contributing to the organization's success does that rank pretty high for you
Agent 109.839000 118.245875 [silence]
Agent 118.245875 125.546375 oh yes and that's one of the reasons [laughter-i] [laughter-like] the University too because_1 you do get credit for your own work um [noise]

Agent 125.546375 131.770875 my ad[visor]- my mentor here es[pecially]- especially he used to work in industry but he couldn't stand it because
Agent 131.770875 142.994875 um [noise] he felt like that his boss at uh at this aero[space]- p[lace]- space company where he worked uh his supervisor got credit for all the um achievements that he made
Agent 142.994875 146.561875 so that's why he came back to the University
Customer 146.460250 152.812875 yeah that's that's kind of a rip when you feel that way
Agent 146.561875 148.036125 and
Agent 148.036125 150.142375 [silence]
Agent 150.142375 159.810375 so i think at the University you get of[ten]- get credit for m[ore]- you know your name gets on what you do like when you publish articles and things like that
Customer 152.812875 158.155375 [silence]

Customer 171.991500 174.065750 sure
Agent 172.816000 184.007250 and i'm specifically interested in the acoustics of speech i'm working now at the N[ational]- National Center for Voice and Speech that's located here at the University of Iowa
Customer 174.065750 182.986000 [silence]
Customer 182.986000 190.797000 so you're kind of interested in this thing that [vocalized-noise] we're participating in then
Agent 184.007250 187.356625 [silence]
Agent 187.356625 199.351125 oh i found out about it because i attended um [noise] a conference for the Acoustical Society of America in Texas and uh [noise] the chairman of the session where i presented a paper um
Customer 190.797000 210.959125 [silence]

Customer 210.959125 218.542875 hm and so you're enjoying all the benefits that a professor would at the moment is there
Agent 211.574250 216.954375 [silence]

Customer 224.082000 226.174375 oh yeah
Agent 225.035250 235.814375 nor the job stability p[ost]- a p[ost]- post doctoral fellow is only for two years but the ultimate goal usually of a post doctoral fellowship is probably to go on and accept a position at a University
Customer 226.174375 260.129750 [silence]
Agent 235.814375 237.574375 so this is
Agent 237.574375 248.406000 um [noise] you know the economy with the Gulf War and everything um last year around the time i was graduating um there -[wa]s just were not very many opportunities available
Agent 248.406000 261.236125 so this was the best thing because_1 um my post doctoral fellowship like this um um is a good thing on your resume for when you apply to be a professor or something like that
Customer 260.129750 268.826125 okay uh David is one of the things that i- i suppose so you don't want to be out in the weather and
Agent 261.236125 275.816500 [silence]
Customer 268.826125 278.350500 uh the environment like construction workers for you it's better to be inside air-conditioned w[arm]- warm
