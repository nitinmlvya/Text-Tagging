Agent 0.000000 2.517500 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 0.126250 [noise]
Customer 0.126250 2.913750 well do you think we're paying too much in taxes right now
Agent 2.517500 7.556875 well frankly i think we're paying too little i think we have paid too little since Reagan and them decided to cut it
Customer 2.913750 40.434375 [silence]
Agent 7.556875 13.994250 uh i used to get these uh surveys from the Republican Party from time to time asking if i thought it was a good idea for them to cut taxes
Agent 13.994250 24.437625 and i kept saying no i felt like what we ought to do is cut spending and keep taxes the way they were well granted maybe the only way they could keep the spending to be uh
Agent 24.437625 35.680000 that is curtail the spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut but uh i always felt like the Congress uh just ought to shoulder responsibilities of biting the bullet
Agent 35.680000 42.280375 uh that they uh uh are are supposed to be able to uh you know handle shoulder
Customer 40.434375 42.287000 yeah
Agent 42.280375 50.579875 and uh cut their spending and if they had uh done that without cutting taxes we wouldn't find ourselves in economic quagmire we're in now
Customer 42.287000 50.100000 [silence]
Customer 50.100000 59.820000 yeah well i think too many people are not paying enough taxes some are paying too much uh the the middle class but the uh upper class the wealthy people are not paying enough
Agent 50.579875 54.522000 [silence]
Agent 54.522000 56.149250 uh-huh
Agent 56.149250 57.604375 [silence]
Agent 57.604375 58.951125 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 58.951125 64.268875 [silence]
Customer 59.820000 65.974250 i think the le[gislation]- that there ought to be legislation that make makes it more equitable for uh depending on how much you earn
Agent 64.268875 66.742125 are you so you like the progressive income tax
Customer 65.974250 72.685000 yeah i sure do uh-huh i we think everybody ought to be paying their fair share there still too many loopholes available to to get by with
Agent 66.742125 69.380250 [silence]
Agent 69.380250 70.771000 well
Agent 70.771000 72.518750 [silence]
Agent 72.518750 82.392375 well i i thought they had closed most of the uh loopholes when they came out with this uh pretty well constant fixed tax type uh about the only well i know there are a few you're right about that but
Customer 72.685000 89.500750 [silence]
Agent 82.392375 90.399625 primarily the only thing that was supposed to be any longer tax deductible was your your first and second home mortgages the interest that is
Customer 89.500750 90.716750 yeah right
Agent 90.399625 95.820500 and that was about it now i think there are still some real estate oriented type tax hedges
Customer 90.716750 95.216500 [silence]
Customer 95.216500 98.697500 they cut it back on rental property income
Agent 95.820500 97.772500 [silence]
Agent 97.772500 99.455875 yeah
Customer 98.697500 107.673375 that uh you can't uh get uh tax deductions on uh say a second third fourth house that you own on paying uh taxes on on that
Agent 99.455875 105.365500 [silence]
Agent 105.365500 110.936250 yeah well that's where the rich see uh certainly have a second third fourth and fifth house
Customer 107.673375 109.316375 right
Customer 109.316375 113.193000 and they also cut back on things like limited partnerships
Agent 110.936250 112.762750 [silence]
Agent 112.762750 118.237000 right uh in what way what loopholes then are are left that you're talking about
Customer 113.193000 117.238000 [silence]
Customer 117.238000 120.156875 well the maximum tax bracket is twenty eight percent
Agent 118.237000 119.483625 [silence]
Agent 119.483625 122.484000 right well thirty three if you're in that hump but
Customer 120.156875 123.245500 so nobody can pay any higher than right
Agent 122.484000 125.214875 yeah but uh uh
Customer 123.245500 128.229875 [silence]
Agent 125.214875 129.260750 uh i i felt like they ought to cut the capital gains tax
Customer 128.229875 131.510250 i think that's right too i agree with that
Agent 129.260750 131.148250 [silence]
Agent 131.148250 143.692500 because it it fo[r]- for once finally with taxes having been cut it makes the little investor like myself capable if you're able to set aside a little money aside to do a little investing and make a few bucks without getting it all taken away from you
Customer 131.510250 142.582750 [silence]
Customer 142.582750 144.551875 sure
Agent 143.692500 148.358375 and you ought to get your salary taxed once and if you're able to save some money to be able to invest in
Customer 144.551875 151.558750 [silence]
Agent 148.358375 155.156375 stocks and bonds and various things like that then to get it stuck to you again seems just a little bit unfair
Customer 151.558750 153.850125 right
Customer 153.850125 158.347875 i'm saying the way our taxes are structured right now it does not encourage saving
Agent 155.156375 158.654375 [silence]
Customer 158.347875 164.882125 [silence]
Agent 158.654375 165.130875 no it really doesn't but on the other hand how how um how would we change it to encourage saving
Customer 164.882125 168.277875 um well that that's a good question
Agent 165.130875 167.117250 [silence]
Agent 167.117250 171.581000 and go back to things like tax free IRAs and like that they wound up coming back
Customer 168.277875 170.226625 [silence]
Customer 170.226625 174.070375 yeah i agree with that that that's i uh
Agent 171.581000 176.199375 okay yeah i thought that was a good move too that certainly in
Customer 174.070375 181.849875 yeah i think i wish we would do that i'm in a bracket right now where i cannot take advantage of an IRA getting a tax deduction on it
Agent 176.199375 181.034375 [silence]
Agent 181.034375 182.794125 i hear you
Customer 181.849875 191.615375 i used to be able to do that but uh i can't now and so then there's also the problem now where i've got some contributions that were tax deductible and some that aren't and i have to keep those separate
Agent 182.794125 184.648875 yeah
Agent 184.648875 186.213250 and now that
Agent 186.213250 190.037750 [silence]
Agent 190.037750 191.267125 right
Agent 191.267125 193.927125 yeah and that's absolutely unfair i agree
Customer 191.615375 223.513250 [silence]
Agent 193.927125 201.957000 and it seems like every time Congress and and and uh the presidency gets a set up like the had now see that's the kind of tax cuts i'm for
Agent 201.957000 214.628375 not necessarily just a a broad range tax cut on salaries so much but tax cuts where they don't tax savings of various kinds you know savings where you're willing to tie your money up at least some minimum period of time s[ome]- some
Agent 214.628375 217.556375 uh minimum number of years and all like like IRAs were
Agent 217.556375 225.816125 uh it it that that those are reasonable alternatives that the average person can get in on and not just the rich alone
Customer 223.513250 225.571250 yeah
Customer 225.571250 235.050375 [silence]
Agent 225.816125 236.753875 but uh uh seems like every time that uh people begin to make a little money at that and a lot of people jumped on IRAs i mean you di[d]- you app[arently]- you apparently did and a lot of people i know did too
Customer 235.050375 240.132875 oh i still do contribute to an IRA even though i can't take advantage of any tax breaks
Agent 236.753875 238.017000 yeah
Agent 238.017000 239.669375 [silence]
Agent 239.669375 249.436875 yeah well i'm in one too but it seems like as soon as they uh got to going like gangbusters and the Congress saw that big pile of money beginning to form out there they wanted to come in and tax it again
Customer 240.132875 248.439750 [silence]
Customer 248.439750 249.746875 sure
Agent 249.436875 253.951375 and and uh that that's only again because they would not
Customer 249.746875 259.344625 [silence]
Agent 253.951375 259.431625 uh uh police themselves and their spending
Customer 259.344625 260.687375 uh-huh
Agent 259.431625 272.407625 and i i don't know i i don't know what else to do about it i mean seems like we are are are constantly reelecting Republican presidents and Democratic Congresses or Democratic presidents and Republican Congresses and they can't ever seem to get together
Customer 260.687375 271.865375 [silence]
Customer 271.865375 281.033375 yeah well i think one of the things that may maybe does en[courage]- encourage uh saving in a small way is that you can't write off taxes on personal spending
Agent 272.407625 281.230125 [silence]
Customer 281.033375 289.316625 uh that may keep a again that may cause a recession as well though because it keeps people from going going out and charging their credit cards uh to the max
Agent 281.230125 282.501125 right
Agent 282.501125 293.848875 [silence]
Customer 289.316625 294.544125 and it cuts down on uh how much uh spending were their going to uh do for the year
Agent 293.848875 300.391500 do you think this latest interest cu[t]- rate cut that the Fed just went through is going to uh get people back on the spending
Customer 294.544125 299.808375 [silence]
Customer 299.808375 311.804125 i'm not so sure about that uh we're still uh in a recession as such and uh it that ta[x]- that cut in the in th[e]- the prime has not encouraged activity in the market yet
Agent 300.391500 303.747750 [silence]
Agent 303.747750 305.576875 yeah
Agent 305.576875 308.747250 [silence]
Agent 308.747250 310.256375 uh-huh
Agent 310.256375 311.691500 [silence]
Agent 311.691500 313.294375 uh-huh
Customer 311.804125 315.531625 i think people are going to follow the stock market if if it takes off
Agent 313.294375 319.869750 [silence]
Customer 315.531625 322.938000 uh that's a good indicator that the economy is turning around and people are going to start spending again right now a lot of people are fearful about their jobs
Agent 319.869750 321.474750 well
Agent 321.474750 322.493000 [silence]
Agent 322.493000 325.242625 oh yeah i know exactly how you feel
Customer 322.938000 329.568250 there are a lot of layoffs uh you know unemployment's way up and uh they're just saving money uh until things get better
Agent 325.242625 326.718375 right
Agent 326.718375 329.006125 [silence]
Agent 329.006125 335.637500 uh-huh uh-huh i uh was talking to a fellow today and he seemed to think it was going to make a difference but i said hey if a lot of people are all ready borrowed up
Customer 329.568250 353.361000 [silence]
Agent 335.637500 345.692375 to the hilt i don't care how cut low you cut taxes they can't afford to borrow anymore or they won't just because they want to try to get a handle on what they have tha[t]- you you've got to cut them
Agent 345.692375 350.657000 drastically such that the uh idea of refinancing
Agent 350.657000 353.951250 at a lower interest rate becomes the thing to do
Customer 353.361000 360.362500 right well you can do that with say a mortgage payment but they charge so many points in order to refinance a lot of people can't afford that
Agent 353.951250 357.325000 [silence]
Agent 357.325000 358.618625 yeah
Agent 358.618625 359.912375 and
Agent 359.912375 372.170750 that's right or or less the break is considerable between the the interest rates and the cut between say eleven percent mortgage down to no more than nine percent mortgage that's not enough you've got to get down to eight maybe even seven and a half
Customer 360.362500 371.690000 [silence]
Customer 371.690000 380.054750 yeah well that's basically what we're doing right now is uh people a lot of people have eleven percent mortgages and they can get nine percent now but it costs them three points to do that
Agent 372.170750 375.965125 [silence]
Agent 375.965125 377.267875 yeah
Agent 377.267875 379.016000 [silence]
Agent 379.016000 382.927250 and that's not enough you need a eight percent loan to be able to do that
Customer 380.054750 388.769500 three percent of yeah three percent of their mo[rtgage]- mortgage right now or or of the uh principal that's left on their loan is uh a significant chunk of change
Agent 382.927250 387.986875 [silence]
Agent 387.986875 389.493000 that's right
Customer 388.769500 391.922500 and uh a lot of people aren't aren't in a position to take advantage of that
Agent 389.493000 391.269500 [silence]
Agent 391.269500 399.668000 so i i i'm not so sure myself that uh that cutting interest rates is going to do it or cutting taxes either i just think we've gotten ourselves so
Customer 391.922500 418.679750 [silence]
Agent 399.668000 404.426125 uh gone through such a uh uh period of time where we've been so credit hungry
Agent 404.426125 412.807250 and um we have gotten uh uh so out on a limb in debt not only uh federal debt but consumer debt too
Agent 412.807250 419.687000 that uh i'm really concerned whether any kind of taxation one way or the other is going to make a difference
Customer 418.679750 427.945875 yeah well another thing that uh kind of irks me right now is i just got my tax appraisal on my house and it went up ten thousand dollars from last year
Agent 419.687000 424.054750 [silence]
Agent 424.054750 425.720625 uh uh-huh
Agent 425.720625 427.698875 [silence]
Agent 427.698875 433.147125 well you know that's what's happened to me i got my appraisal well we get them up here they give them to you three years out
Customer 427.945875 429.315875 there's
Customer 429.315875 432.582375 [silence]
Customer 432.582375 434.136625 uh-huh
Agent 433.147125 436.508250 i mean you you get one every year but it it it
Customer 434.136625 439.316125 [silence]
Agent 436.508250 442.936750 puts in at a what they expect it to be for the next three years you know based on what it is right now subject to change of course
Customer 439.316125 441.248250 right
Customer 441.248250 452.189250 [silence]
Agent 442.936750 452.981250 and uh real estate values up here in in the uh uh uh eastern corridor have dropped about two and a half to five percent
Customer 452.189250 457.707875 real estate values here have dropped at least ten percent over the past uh two years
Agent 452.981250 454.882500 [silence]
Agent 454.882500 456.226500 okay
Agent 456.226500 462.599750 well see the pressure's is more up here so it hasn't dropped quite as bad because the population being what it is but nevertheless it's dropped
Customer 457.707875 459.306125 [silence]
Customer 459.306125 460.659375 right
Customer 460.659375 486.459875 [silence]
Agent 462.599750 472.771750 but uh this hasn't been reflected in my appraisals and i was just telling my wife the other night you know i says i- i wonder who it is you talk to here in the state ab[out]- about protesting this because
Agent 472.771750 478.264000 if and only uh interest rates i'm sorry uh proper[ty]- values don't come back up
Agent 478.264000 487.383500 which means i can see that i can uh get again at least what i could have gotten for my house a year ago then i'm not being fairly appraised
Customer 486.459875 487.711750 right
Agent 487.383500 497.304750 [silence]
Customer 487.711750 493.163375 there's no justification here for an increase in uh the value of a home
Customer 493.163375 497.651500 the property values are still going down and i'm not sure they've hit the bottom yet
Agent 497.304750 500.182500 um in the Texas area
Customer 497.651500 499.739250 so uh when when they
Customer 499.739250 505.308500 yes when they all of a sudden increase with all the layoffs and what not uh real estate prices have not been going up
Agent 500.182500 501.460250 uh-huh
Agent 501.460250 505.190750 [silence]
Agent 505.190750 506.521625 ha
Customer 505.308500 512.937625 uh there's too many too many homes on the market right now too many people are just bailing out on their homes and leaving them their abandoning abandoning their homes
Agent 506.521625 507.036125 [silence]
Agent 507.036125 508.719375 uh-huh
Agent 508.719375 511.702750 [silence]
Agent 511.702750 513.879625 is a lot of that going on
Customer 512.937625 517.865875 oh yes there's two homes on my street right now that sure
Agent 513.879625 517.724875 um that's going to put the banks in dire straights
Agent 517.724875 520.845250 because the banks don't want the property they want the money
Customer 517.865875 519.665125 [silence]
Customer 519.665125 529.264250 that's right there are a lot of banks that are in trouble we've had banks that have been closing for the past two years in Texas we've got a record number of banks that have been go[ne]- all ready gone under
Agent 520.845250 525.591625 [silence]
Agent 525.591625 526.940250 yeah
Agent 526.940250 528.119125 [silence]
Agent 528.119125 532.074500 well do you see where the tax situation could really help that any
Customer 529.264250 531.322125 [silence]
Customer 531.322125 536.106750 uh no i don't i think that's mostly with the economy and the job market
Agent 532.074500 535.550125 [silence]
Agent 535.550125 536.823875 uh-huh
Customer 536.106750 542.893500 but i think it's unfair that uh the tax appraisal has gone up this year when in fact the uh the value of the homes has not
Agent 536.823875 539.722875 [silence]
Agent 539.722875 541.403000 oh i do too
Agent 541.403000 542.528875 [silence]
Agent 542.528875 550.830375 yeah yeah i think it's absolutely unfair but they've gotten into this mentality and uh i don't think they know how to appraise a house down
Customer 542.893500 550.841125 [silence]
Agent 550.830375 556.458500 [silence]
Customer 550.841125 559.950125 yeah i don't know h[ow]- what they use to justify that uh because say i've got the same model home as some of my neighbors and they're all appraised at the same level
Agent 556.458500 558.366750 yeah
Agent 558.366750 559.450375 [silence]
Agent 559.450375 560.692250 yeah
Customer 559.950125 567.468625 even though i've made more improvements on my house than somebody else has and nobody comes out to take a look and see what you've done to get a proper appraisal
Agent 560.692250 567.179000 [silence]
Agent 567.179000 576.312250 now out here they do they take pictures of house and everything and what they do is they look at what your particular model at least three of them have sold for within the last twelve months
Customer 567.468625 578.135250 [silence]
Agent 576.312250 582.468375 or later if if they have the data they don't always have that much data because they may not have sold that many of your model
Customer 578.135250 579.690750 okay
