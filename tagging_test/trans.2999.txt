Agent 116.732125 123.228250 [silence]

Customer 123.954875 124.953250 [laughter]
Customer 124.953250 129.849625 [silence]
Customer 129.849625 132.536750 i had that hassle one time and
Agent 130.801250 138.510375 [silence]
Customer 132.536750 137.727000 i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and
Customer 137.727000 147.962750 deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it
Agent 138.510375 139.982500 huh
Agent 139.982500 153.051125 [silence]
Customer 147.962750 150.503250 so you know
Customer 150.503250 154.226125 i guess i don't know who the the burden of proof is on
Agent 153.051125 155.308625 yeah i don't either
Customer 154.226125 155.850625 you know it's kind of a
Agent 155.308625 159.210000 [silence]
Customer 155.850625 159.991500 because you never d[o]- when i pay bills i don't make a Xerox copy of it or i don't
Agent 159.210000 162.483375 no you figure you'll get your check back if you have to
Customer 159.991500 161.433500 um

Agent 162.483375 165.215750 [silence]
Agent 165.215750 166.653625 yeah
Agent 166.653625 170.910250 [silence]
Customer 166.985500 169.031250 to have a proof of when i mailed it
Customer 169.031250 171.570000 and i mean you can't do that it'd be ridiculous
Agent 170.910250 179.051250 [laughter] really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state you know where if something's wrong
Customer 171.570000 178.963875 [silence]
Customer 178.963875 179.977000 right
Agent 179.051250 185.513500 you don't want to end up having to pay for it a couple times i've had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didn't really get this or
Customer 179.977000 181.029125 [silence]
Customer 181.029125 181.938875 well you can
Customer 181.938875 185.563875 [silence]
Agent 185.513500 187.379250 i don't know what this is
Customer 185.563875 193.133375 right or i returned it so don't charge it yeah well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um
Agent 187.379250 188.610375 yeah
Agent 188.610375 197.527875 [silence]
Customer 193.133375 196.186250 d[idn't]- wasn't didn't do what
Customer 196.186250 202.672625 these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldn't do that so he brought it back to them and they're supposed to modify it
Agent 197.527875 198.816625 uh-huh
Agent 198.816625 208.241375 [silence]
Customer 202.672625 208.815625 and so i called the credit card company and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us we can't use it
Agent 208.241375 209.382750 uh-huh
Customer 208.815625 212.061750 and then they said well then don't pay it
Agent 209.382750 223.680875 [silence]
Customer 212.061750 224.920625 and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soo[n]- as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now they're hitting [vocalized-noise] [laughter] with a finance charge
Agent 223.680875 225.718125 oh [laughter]
Customer 224.920625 227.346000 but it's sort of you know it's it's half our fault
Agent 225.718125 226.999625 [silence]
Agent 226.999625 230.956750 yeah since it w[ell]- yeah if you filed that letter with them then they'll kind of
Customer 227.346000 228.983125 and so w[e]-
Customer 228.983125 230.356000 [silence]
Customer 230.356000 234.251000 right if i'd filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay
Agent 230.956750 233.708500 [silence]
Agent 233.708500 234.808500 yeah
Customer 234.251000 236.354375 so i learned that for the next time
Agent 234.808500 236.367750 [silence]
Customer 236.354375 237.536375 yeah
Agent 236.367750 245.134750 i'm like you too about the yearly fees i don't uh i don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we don't have to pay a yearly fee on and
Customer 237.536375 244.416625 [silence]
Customer 244.416625 245.506750 uh-huh
Agent 245.134750 248.284875 since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate
Customer 245.506750 247.781500 [silence]
Customer 247.781500 249.397000 right yeah
Agent 248.284875 252.423125 is to us as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee now we had American Express cards
Customer 249.397000 261.483875 [silence]
Agent 252.423125 253.533500 and
Agent 253.533500 258.191250 my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided
Agent 258.191250 265.081625 for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety [laughter-dollars] or something i think i can't remember but we decided let that one go and
Customer 261.483875 262.847750 yeah
Customer 262.847750 264.201500 [silence]
Customer 264.201500 271.505750 well my husband and i both have that and i don't know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think it's like seventy five dollars for me
Agent 265.081625 269.071625 [silence]
Agent 269.071625 269.901750 uh-huh
Agent 269.901750 271.011125 [silence]
Agent 271.011125 272.030000 yeah
Customer 271.505750 275.807000 and i'm not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like [vocalized-noise]
Agent 272.030000 279.366250 [silence]
Customer 275.807000 277.057625 there
Customer 277.057625 284.458375 nowadays i'm not su[re]- so sure that it's worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express
Agent 279.366250 280.270000 um-hum
Agent 280.270000 284.080125 [silence]
Agent 284.080125 285.386625 yeah
Customer 284.458375 285.715000 and then
Agent 285.386625 291.382000 [silence]
Customer 285.715000 291.555500 they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel
Agent 291.382000 292.577125 yeah
Customer 291.555500 296.436000 if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card
Agent 292.577125 308.001500 [silence]
Customer 296.436000 298.429875 and um
Customer 298.429875 305.278250 with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell you that but then that was one advantage but th[at's]- that's like
Customer 305.278250 308.474125 i don't i think it's seventy five dollars for me and forty for him
Agent 308.001500 309.514750 uh-huh
Customer 308.474125 309.955500 for a year which is a lot
Agent 309.514750 311.270250 yeah
Customer 309.955500 310.987750 [silence]
Customer 310.987750 312.349125 be [vocalized-noise]
Agent 311.270250 316.235125 but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff
Customer 312.349125 316.049875 [silence]
Customer 316.049875 325.409250 yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one that's free because there are some like i think AT&T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year
Agent 316.235125 317.416375 it's more worth it
Agent 317.416375 319.078625 [silence]
Agent 319.078625 320.182625 uh-huh
Agent 320.182625 324.902875 [silence]
Agent 324.902875 326.057500 oh
Customer 325.409250 326.427250 well so
Agent 326.057500 328.485750 [laughter] yeah that wouldn't be too hard to do [laughter]
Customer 326.427250 327.572500 [silence]
Customer 327.572500 335.572375 yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true that's um i[t]- it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit
Agent 328.485750 335.206875 [silence]
Agent 335.206875 336.543750 yeah
Customer 335.572375 339.186500 and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much
Agent 336.543750 338.838250 [silence]
Agent 338.838250 346.007875 have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that we've never had that problem either
Customer 339.186500 342.860750 [silence]
Customer 342.860750 344.103375 no
Customer 344.103375 345.312500 no
Customer 345.312500 350.491875 i and i don't under[stand]- i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i don't understand
Agent 346.007875 360.819625 [silence]
Customer 350.491875 351.696875 [silence]
Customer 351.696875 361.489875 yeah because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process
Agent 360.819625 362.341000 um-hum
Customer 361.489875 365.697500 and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like oh well i [laughter-guess] i have to pay that too
Agent 362.341000 363.926125 [silence]
Agent 363.926125 366.244250 [laughter-yeah]
Customer 365.697500 376.580000 because_1 yesterday like many times i'll tr[y]- i'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill not this bill and it'll come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway
Agent 366.244250 372.293375 [silence]
Agent 372.293375 373.646500 right
Agent 373.646500 375.509625 [silence]
Agent 375.509625 377.613625 yeah [laughter]
Customer 376.580000 381.213250 but sometimes the [vocalized-noise] is long like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months
Agent 377.613625 381.066125 [silence]
Agent 381.066125 387.052000 yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have
Customer 381.213250 384.857125 [silence]
Customer 384.857125 385.867625 yeah
Customer 385.867625 390.526875 [silence]
Agent 387.052000 392.903125 tho[se]- i guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute you charge it yeah
Customer 390.526875 398.150250 immediately yeah but that's what happened with us like we bought a washing [laughter-machine] [laughter-seven] months ago and then i got billed like the next [laughter-day]
Agent 392.903125 394.443750 [silence]
Agent 394.443750 395.709625 oh
Agent 395.709625 397.460250 [silence]
Agent 397.460250 398.983250 oh [laughter-gosh]
Customer 398.150250 407.945125 it didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check but we prefer [vocalized-noise] like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that
Agent 398.983250 406.949375 [silence]
Agent 406.949375 409.016625 yeah that's nice
Customer 407.945125 410.807625 you can uh return it so like the washing machine
Agent 409.016625 419.657625 [silence]
Customer 410.807625 413.581250 we bought it in October and
Customer 413.581250 414.658875 [silence]
Customer 414.658875 420.350125 you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee
Agent 419.657625 420.910125 right
Customer 420.350125 422.866000 and somethings like that are
Agent 420.910125 422.062625 [silence]
Agent 422.062625 427.645000 yeah i like that feature and the insur[ance]- like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something that's breakable
Customer 422.866000 425.372625 [silence]
Customer 425.372625 426.736625 right
Customer 426.736625 441.651000 or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your bagga[ge]- but things like if your baggage gets lost
Agent 427.645000 429.160125 [silence]
Agent 429.160125 430.488000 yeah
Agent 430.488000 438.427125 [silence]
Agent 438.427125 439.509625 [laughter]
Agent 439.509625 442.827875 [silence]
Customer 441.651000 443.407750 you get money for that
Agent 442.827875 444.444750 oh really
Customer 443.407750 445.549000 to buy new bags and things like that
Agent 444.444750 445.954250 oh i didn't know that
Customer 445.549000 449.698875 and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so
Agent 445.954250 449.698875 [silence]
