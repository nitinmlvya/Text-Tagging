Agent 0.000000 35.739625 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 3.367125 well a large organization offers uh
Customer 3.367125 10.889875 usually a good vacation time and they offer uh holidays and and
Customer 10.889875 19.475875 medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff uh personal leave or whatever you need
Customer 19.475875 30.618125 and one thing that i've found coming in handy lately is juror duty uh being paid for that or or at least a full days pay plus whatever the the local government pays you
Customer 30.618125 36.722375 it's nice to be able to do that and not have to concern yourself with your job as it were especially if you get on a case
Agent 35.739625 37.147375 that's true
Customer 36.722375 38.189500 so uh
Agent 37.147375 40.088625 and you get sequestered or something then you're there for months
Customer 38.189500 40.442625 [silence]
Agent 40.088625 41.741750 [laughter]
Customer 40.442625 41.885625 um-hum
Agent 41.741750 44.828500 w[hen]- when you get sequestered and you're there for months
Customer 41.885625 43.775375 [silence]
Customer 43.775375 46.313625 right that would be uh a
Agent 44.828500 46.344750 true
Customer 46.313625 60.493875 problem of course in my job i don't know who would do it while i'm gone that long we're desperately trying to find time to uh train someone else to do it but i feel certainly it would still be there if if not burying me but [laughter-uh] [laughter-it'll] [laughter-be] [laughter-there] [laughter-when] [laughter-i] [laughter-get] [laughter-back]
Agent 46.344750 87.654875 [silence]
Customer 60.493875 68.589500 uh flex times another benefit that i- i like that TI's been doing uh though officially they just started it uh
Customer 68.589500 74.541875 uh relatively recently uh we were always given the privilege with our
Customer 74.541875 81.130375 supervisor that was there we were really small shop and there was only one shift so we didn't interfere with anyone and
Customer 81.130375 95.440875 he liked the idea of having someone there early enough to handle third shift's concerns and late enough to handle second shift and so he allowed us to come in basically as we as we wanted to and as it worked out two or three of us were there about six in the morning and
Agent 87.654875 88.901000 yeah
Agent 88.901000 112.788875 [silence]
Customer 95.440875 105.506500 and later on well eight to nine o'clock some other ones would show up and that puts people there at the five o'clock time frame and it really worked out well and then then of course they came long and sanctioned it and
Customer 105.506500 110.620250 and actually made it a little worse in that they said they didn't want any of us starting before six thirty so
Customer 110.620250 116.287750 uh it wasn't too much of a blow but uh the people that we were interfacing with didn't like that [laughter-too] [laughter-well]
Agent 112.788875 114.335250 [laughter]
Agent 114.335250 115.394750 [silence]
Agent 115.394750 117.124875 yeah right
Customer 116.287750 121.352375 they have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in but uh
Agent 117.124875 134.362875 [silence]
Customer 121.352375 131.152750 it's it's nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and uh not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours that's that's a real benefit
Customer 131.152750 134.350375 what have you found that you like in a big organization
Customer 134.350375 165.529375 [silence]
Agent 134.362875 137.403375 well as as you say the the um
Agent 137.403375 146.405625 benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that
Agent 146.405625 153.237375 it is a boo[m]- a a a plus to have that ev[en]- as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it
Agent 153.237375 166.002875 because_1 it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good in[surance]- uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRA's
Customer 165.529375 166.860625 um-hum
Agent 166.002875 169.344250 uh the profit sharing the stock options
Customer 166.860625 178.113125 [silence]
Agent 169.344250 180.742875 there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is
Customer 178.113125 179.591875 um-hum
Customer 179.591875 180.964125 right
Agent 180.742875 182.510500 and um
Customer 180.964125 205.073250 [silence]
Agent 182.510500 189.118750 i think that uh a a lot of it's the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job
Agent 189.118750 192.245250 uh the incentive you know to want to do a good job
Agent 192.245250 194.139250 and the um
Agent 194.139250 200.133875 MIR awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people
Agent 200.133875 203.387500 and they're uh meetings
Agent 203.387500 205.654000 to keep you full informed
Customer 205.073250 206.398125 um-hum
Agent 205.654000 217.764750 you don't find that much in small companies because_1 you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's going on
Customer 206.398125 216.953000 [silence]
Customer 216.953000 218.284750 right
Agent 217.764750 219.953125 that type of thing um
Customer 218.284750 222.092250 [silence]
Agent 219.953125 220.956875 [silence]
Agent 220.956875 222.151250 uh
Customer 222.092250 223.321750 do you
Agent 222.151250 227.377750 we interface kind of like uh on the tip teams and things i think that's a good deal
Customer 223.321750 226.228125 [silence]
Customer 226.228125 227.583500 right
Agent 227.377750 233.552250 it gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the organization and that you're heard
Customer 227.583500 236.582250 [silence]
Agent 233.552250 237.182125 and know and if you have ideas that type of thing
Customer 236.582250 245.624750 um-hum do you find that your vacation time do you manage to use it up or do you end up into the must use okay
Agent 237.182125 242.775000 [silence]
Agent 242.775000 246.928750 oh i use it up [laughter]
Customer 245.624750 252.215125 there's a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact uh just
Agent 246.928750 269.568750 [silence]
Customer 252.215125 262.480500 tend not to get around to taking it all at once and uh by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and
Customer 262.480500 271.511125 and uh i'm still doing uh my wife works uh half of a half of one day one day a week so on Thursdays
Agent 269.568750 271.791375 do you have a mandatory
Customer 271.511125 272.649125 excuse me
Agent 271.791375 274.528500 uh do you have a mandatory shut down
Customer 272.649125 274.055125 [silence]
Customer 274.055125 281.215125 no we don't have uh we do have mass vacation but in our group it doesn't apply we're so busy year round yeah
Agent 274.528500 278.401125 [silence]
Agent 278.401125 283.656750 oh that's why see see you can you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice
Customer 281.215125 283.160250 [silence]
Customer 283.160250 284.736000 right too
Agent 283.656750 292.784750 that's the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to
Customer 284.736000 291.664500 [silence]
Customer 291.664500 293.816500 take it when you want to yeah
Agent 292.784750 298.052375 but we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know
Customer 293.816500 296.993125 [silence]
Customer 296.993125 298.271625 right
Agent 298.052375 305.207625 and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that they're supplying
Customer 298.271625 304.632500 [silence]
Customer 304.632500 305.906125 right
Agent 305.207625 310.069250 but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at Texas Instruments
Customer 305.906125 309.507125 [silence]
Customer 309.507125 310.881750 um-hum
Agent 310.069250 315.925000 and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know you're not in the same area
Customer 310.881750 315.248875 [silence]
Customer 315.248875 316.571500 right
Agent 315.925000 320.046000 so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time
Customer 316.571500 328.003750 [silence]
Agent 320.046000 321.931625 so that isn't too nice
Agent 321.931625 328.840125 uh this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time
Customer 328.003750 329.155875 oh boy
Agent 328.840125 332.810250 to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people
Customer 329.155875 330.159625 [laughter]
Customer 330.159625 332.005875 [silence]
Customer 332.005875 333.477125 yeah
Agent 332.810250 335.503875 so that's quite a feat in itself
Customer 333.477125 334.934375 [silence]
Customer 334.934375 336.562500 yeah it is
Agent 335.503875 356.096375 [silence]
Customer 336.562500 347.637625 we've got um if i take half a day off during the summertime when the kids are out of school i can manage to be home in time to uh take care of the kids before the wife leaves she works
Customer 347.637625 360.227000 uh oh i starts about eleven or twelve o'clock uh at the dentist office and works until seven thirty or eight that's just one late night to it to clean teeth as it were and
Agent 356.096375 357.490250 uh-huh
Agent 357.490250 373.118500 [silence]
Customer 360.227000 370.165750 he had a hard time finding someone that was willing to work that that that seldom and in those hours and she didn't mind keeping her hand in the business while the kids were growing up as it were and
Customer 370.165750 379.328750 she worked that day and then occasional Saturdays and uh with with the vacation time even if i takeoff the ten or twelve times a
Agent 373.118500 374.498500 uh-huh
Agent 374.498500 387.631750 [silence]
Customer 379.328750 388.732625 a Thursday during the summer i still don't eat up all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then having a day or two left over on top of that so
Agent 387.631750 389.507250 oh that's great
Customer 388.732625 396.619750 it's it's kind of nice to be able to do both and uh i'll probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves
Agent 389.507250 395.908500 [silence]
Agent 395.908500 398.328000 yeah really that's excellent
Customer 396.619750 397.798750 [silence]
Customer 397.798750 411.224250 so yeah it's nice to have these little little benefits that i know wouldn't uh wouldn't happen in a real small company several of my friends have left uh the Metroplex is just full of little companies and they've left TI to go to a little company and
Agent 398.328000 424.237375 [silence]
Customer 411.224250 420.031750 and ended up you know even though they started with some vacation time uh it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and
Customer 420.031750 425.557125 it just wasn't as convenient as being able to say well tomorrow i think i will [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
Agent 424.237375 426.244625 yeah yeah
Customer 425.557125 432.203500 and uh then they don't have quite the job security although you know now there's a lot of people getting cut but
Agent 426.244625 437.444125 [silence]
Customer 432.203500 438.239000 still but by and large the majority of people that are still there in even in the defense industry uh
Agent 437.444125 438.804750 yeah
Customer 438.239000 446.561250 if the job has got something you know something worth doing as far as the contract goes if there is a contract then you're probably pretty secure on that contract
Agent 438.804750 445.716875 [silence]
Agent 445.716875 446.984375 yeah
Customer 446.561250 448.056500 and
Agent 446.984375 451.861875 well they're doing a lot with um automation specialist also that's what i do
Customer 448.056500 455.249000 [silence]
Agent 451.861875 461.107500 uh where you have to go to school to or run the new au[tomated]- automated equipment it's all computerized and and stuff
Customer 455.249000 456.524875 um-hum
Customer 456.524875 458.176125 [silence]
Customer 458.176125 459.476625 um-hum
Customer 459.476625 467.701500 [silence]
Agent 461.107500 473.116875 and uh there's a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to uh come up to an experience level where you're able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance uh
Customer 467.701500 469.012375 right
Customer 469.012375 493.540875 [silence]
Agent 473.116875 478.474875 diagnose what's wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things
Agent 478.474875 481.575000 and interface with the technicians in the toolroom
Agent 481.575000 485.193625 so you're kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes
Agent 485.193625 493.985375 and um it's about a two year to three year experience before you're able to really um i would say payback
Customer 493.540875 494.793750 right
Agent 493.985375 496.584500 you know and and do the job well
Customer 494.793750 496.451625 [silence]
Customer 496.451625 498.033250 well that's good
Agent 496.584500 502.130375 and you're still learning even after all that time because_1 they're very complex machines
Customer 498.033250 499.300125 [silence]
Customer 499.300125 501.504125 yeah it's good that you can
Customer 501.504125 507.060750 pick up something that adds to both your your security and your knowledge base [laughter]
Agent 502.130375 505.110125 [silence]
Agent 505.110125 508.280125 exactly that's right
Customer 507.060750 509.525625 you're getting two things at once there
Agent 508.280125 509.816625 yeah
Customer 509.525625 511.132750 well have
Agent 509.816625 514.374500 and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school
Customer 511.132750 514.052125 [silence]
Customer 514.052125 515.464000 um-hum
Agent 514.374500 521.882875 that's another good uh benefit that TI has and they'll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them
Customer 515.464000 518.995875 [silence]
Customer 518.995875 520.195000 right
Customer 520.195000 521.457750 [silence]
Customer 521.457750 522.735625 right
Agent 521.882875 527.512250 you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years
Customer 522.735625 529.521875 [silence]
Agent 527.512250 530.188250 or uh you know to that affect
Customer 529.521875 530.864375 um-hum
Agent 530.188250 538.786375 and you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you can't if you're you know signed in a contract
Customer 530.864375 538.701625 [silence]
Customer 538.701625 540.051500 um-hum
Agent 538.786375 541.244500 whereas at TI they don't do that
Customer 540.051500 541.292875 [silence]
Agent 541.244500 561.617750 [silence]
Customer 541.292875 544.207375 yeah i've i've looked at several uh
Customer 544.207375 549.947625 courses as it were the only problem that we have is things that are that are specifically on our job
Customer 549.947625 556.681875 uh that the courses that apply to our job other than the real basics like just the math and the physics and the like
Customer 556.681875 565.989250 uh all of them are taught at colleges that are very remote in other words there like there's one in Washington DC [laughter-and] there's one in Oregon
Agent 561.617750 563.478875 oh
Agent 563.478875 565.424875 oh
Agent 565.424875 566.885125 oh
Customer 565.989250 576.257375 and they're they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training but just keeping up on the basics i guess are things that we could continue to do but um
Agent 566.885125 573.397500 [silence]
Agent 573.397500 574.591625 yeah
Agent 574.591625 575.597875 [silence]
Agent 575.597875 579.928625 well this part of the country there's no sh[ortage]- shortage of uh good schools

Customer 586.421875 589.782375 [silence]
Customer 589.782375 591.088375 um-hum
