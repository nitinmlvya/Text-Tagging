Agent 35.440375 37.104375 uh-huh
Customer 36.347125 39.092750 so there's the potential that perhaps
Agent 37.104375 49.477750 [silence]
Customer 39.092750 43.283875 you know the US budget might wanna take a look at it's uh federal

Customer 47.569500 59.893250 wages i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a [shirt/short] that's got to be very short term
Agent 49.477750 50.916625 um-hum
Agent 50.916625 52.740250 [silence]

Customer 59.893250 67.357875 a[nd]- and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as
Agent 60.899500 75.030125 [silence]
Customer 67.357875 75.263875 saying [noise] well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh
Agent 75.030125 76.903875 yep
Customer 75.263875 84.421750 for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them_1 four hundred five hundred dollars
Agent 76.903875 83.730000 [silence]
Agent 83.730000 85.359875 [noise] right

Agent 85.359875 86.977625 [noise]
Agent 86.977625 89.726250 [silence]
Agent 89.726250 91.455875 yep

Customer 148.692875 159.929625 uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences they were using it as eating out um when you think about people
Customer 159.929625 173.288500 uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in [laughter-congress] the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that and it's a real big crunch
