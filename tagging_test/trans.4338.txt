Agent 106.717875 117.420750 um and my my company has a uh a pretax medical deduction uh medical and uh child care uh all together so

Customer 145.722125 146.941750 um-hum
Agent 146.238125 157.810000 and they were set up as as first birthday presents or or or even newborn presents from the grandparents just you know the the actually assembled and set up
Customer 146.941750 180.776000 [silence]
Agent 157.810000 161.512750 uh all the investment decisions are are now ours
Agent 161.512750 169.992500 but in terms of retirement that's the one area that that is is still a little sticky because yo[u]- yo[u]- you sort of have your retirement plans through your companies
Agent 169.992500 176.083250 and we spent so much time trying to to make sure that the boys are okay [laughter] that
Agent 176.083250 186.271625 an[d]- you know for our own retirement there's not a whole lot actually organized but we do have uh the things through our companies so that's that's a start anyway
Customer 180.776000 182.031375 um-hum
Customer 182.031375 187.090125 [silence]

Agent 192.892250 194.276000 um-hum
Customer 193.765000 202.587375 for the previous nine years or so we've just pretty much let it slide um there really wasn't much problem as far as income versus expenses
Agent 194.276000 198.188750 [noise]
Agent 198.188750 206.689125 [silence]
Customer 202.587375 204.852375 uh things are getting a little bit tighter
Customer 204.852375 215.311000 uh we bought a house last year we bought a new vehicle things that which weren't a problem before have have all sudden we noticed our cash flow is starting to decline a little bit
Agent 206.689125 208.265625 um
Agent 208.265625 214.795250 [silence]
Agent 214.795250 216.535625 [noise]
Customer 215.311000 217.948625 you know with all the monthly bills and uh
Agent 216.535625 227.954375 [silence]
Customer 217.948625 222.731500 uh so far it's working out pretty well you know we're keeping an eye on what we spend each week
Customer 222.731500 228.516125 but like i said being one of the first months we really won't know for a few more months down the road how well we're doing
Agent 227.954375 229.235125 um
Customer 228.516125 232.702875 but your plan where you you submit bills that's the most
Agent 229.235125 235.396875 [silence]
Customer 232.702875 237.269500 itemized plan i've ever seen or heard anyone talk about as far as married couples
Agent 235.396875 236.770000 yeah
Agent 236.770000 248.070250 well it's not it's not actually too bad once you get the s[preadsheet]- the spreadsheet set out by my husband has categories for things like utilities uh you know other expenses
Customer 237.269500 238.424000 [silence]
Customer 238.424000 240.006375 interesting
Customer 240.006375 253.069500 [silence]
Agent 248.070250 253.619375 uh the rent and my contribution i don't make as much financially as he does
Customer 253.069500 254.396750 um-hum
Agent 253.619375 265.093375 so my contribution is prorated it doesn't come it doesn't come fifty percent out of my pocket when i don't make fifty percent of the income uh you know which is nice it's fair
Customer 254.396750 263.507500 [silence]
Customer 263.507500 264.904375 fair enough
Customer 264.904375 294.333625 [silence]
Agent 265.093375 273.336500 uh so actually what it what happens is that we gather all the bills and then write them down and then uh
Agent 273.336500 284.814750 w[ell]- uh after that it's just a question of putting them into the computer and the computer generates you know i mean it it takes the percentage that's necessary and he prints out a bill and i write a check and that's it
Agent 284.814750 288.524000 um once it's set up it works it works reasonable well
Agent 288.524000 300.226000 so i[t]- it most of my friends though when they find out about it the[y]- the[y]- they think your husband submits a bill to you that's that's that's weird [laughter] that's really weird but we don't i mean i
Customer 294.333625 296.362000 [laughter]
Customer 296.362000 300.226000 [silence]
