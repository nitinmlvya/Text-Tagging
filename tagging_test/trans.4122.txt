Agent 125.403250 127.067250 oh really
Customer 125.897875 135.761375 um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an HMO

Agent 137.294000 139.336375 [silence]

Agent 149.489625 157.154500 [silence]
Customer 155.367000 158.032250 but if you want something really fancy you pay the difference

Agent 202.110125 203.741250 um-hum
Agent 203.741250 207.422125 [silence]
Agent 207.422125 209.699625 especially when they're younger
Customer 208.436500 214.524875 yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment to cover the uh
Agent 209.699625 212.304000 [silence]
Agent 212.304000 213.511375 yeah
Agent 213.511375 216.499875 [silence]

Customer 216.951000 219.377000 yeah some seems more honest
Agent 217.718500 218.784750 [silence]
Agent 218.784750 220.750625 and though and the
Customer 219.377000 226.422000 [silence]

Agent 235.891750 241.371125 um that's what i was trying to i think there is i don't really remember how long it is
Customer 235.905875 241.065500 [silence]
Customer 241.065500 242.477500 uh-huh
Agent 241.371125 246.981750 but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get adjusted i guess
Customer 242.477500 246.108250 [silence]
Customer 246.108250 247.512125 uh
Agent 246.981750 248.341000 and um

Customer 259.967250 261.302750 uh-huh
Agent 260.556125 268.213375 and if and if your doctor's on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company
Customer 261.302750 267.238250 [silence]
Customer 267.238250 271.327375 i see so they they're preferred providers or is that a

Agent 275.367125 277.807500 yeah um-hum
