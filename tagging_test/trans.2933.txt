Customer 25.162875 28.808625 [silence]
Customer 28.808625 41.500000 yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if you're not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year
Agent 29.667500 41.819250 [silence]
Customer 41.500000 43.972000 then you don't get the benefit
Agent 41.819250 45.161375 then they uh adjust it accordingly

Agent 45.161375 46.226125 [silence]

Customer 61.634625 74.276375 [silence]
Agent 62.115000 65.206250 always had access to to good
Agent 65.206250 71.000500 benefits as far as insurance and and usually some dental and
Agent 71.000500 72.001750 [silence]
Agent 72.001750 76.535250 life insurance and that kind of thing you know and
Customer 74.276375 80.561500 right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldn't be able to do the temporary work
Agent 76.535250 78.282125 [silence]
Agent 78.282125 81.217000 yeah exactly
Customer 80.561500 84.387500 i think medical is probably one of the most important things
Agent 81.217000 84.114250 [silence]
Agent 84.114250 92.029000 i know uh here sometime back you know they ha[d]- had had given him a printout you know of uh
Customer 84.387500 85.993000 to have
Customer 85.993000 106.880750 [silence]
Agent 92.029000 97.537125 money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much he'd paid and
Agent 97.537125 107.712250 um the medical benefits and whatnot that uh he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary
Customer 106.880750 108.447625 wow
Agent 107.712250 112.547000 even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and
Customer 108.447625 109.917375 [silence]
Customer 109.917375 111.431125 um-hum
Customer 111.431125 124.243625 [silence]
Agent 112.547000 124.490375 and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well i'm not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess it's there knowing that it could be used if you
Customer 124.243625 132.825125 yeah those must be pretty good benefits i've heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his company's a little bit better
Agent 124.490375 126.327000 so chose
Agent 126.327000 130.432250 [silence]
Agent 130.432250 131.762125 yeah
Agent 131.762125 137.732375 yeah i uh we've always been dealt fairly with that way
Customer 132.825125 166.424750 [silence]
Agent 137.732375 141.060375 and i would certainly you know
Agent 141.060375 150.734375 caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and
Agent 150.734375 158.618500 how they're going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage
Agent 158.618500 162.406000 if you knew that uh long term the
Agent 162.406000 167.147500 you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know
Customer 166.424750 168.555500 right yeah
Agent 167.147500 170.376000 whatever you know the differences in the
Customer 168.555500 178.235625 [silence]
Agent 170.376000 177.846750 you know in the benefits we belong to an HMO through my husband's work is do you is that the kind of medical
Agent 177.846750 179.370000 you have
Customer 178.235625 185.636375 uh no fortunately we still have the it's just regular traveler's insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere
Agent 179.370000 185.444375 [silence]
Agent 185.444375 187.019125 um-hum
Customer 185.636375 190.096375 i guess that's good i don't know uh i can't decide
Agent 187.019125 188.357375 [silence]
Agent 188.357375 190.248125 well we uh
Customer 190.096375 191.778125 [silence]
Agent 190.248125 196.340500 we have five children so it's been good for us to uh to have the HMO for the most part
Customer 191.778125 193.927250 oh yeah
Customer 193.927250 218.495125 [silence]
Agent 196.340500 209.391250 we're in a different one now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low
Agent 209.391250 219.616250 and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so
Customer 218.495125 219.988875 uh-huh
Agent 219.616250 227.222875 if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you don't see them as elective
Customer 219.988875 225.254875 [silence]
Customer 225.254875 226.325750 [laughter]
Customer 226.325750 227.589875 really
Agent 227.222875 228.528000 then uh
Customer 227.589875 231.925375 [silence]
Agent 228.528000 229.759250 you know
Agent 229.759250 234.279250 uh you know you may not get the coverage that's you might have
Customer 231.925375 239.969000 yeah my husband works [noise] for a psych hospital and i know that they sometimes have to discharge people before they're really ready because their insurance
Agent 234.279250 241.157500 [silence]
Customer 239.969000 248.304000 won't let them_1 stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone
Agent 241.157500 242.747500 uh-huh
Agent 242.747500 245.032375 [silence]
Agent 245.032375 248.278125 that's right that's right
Agent 248.278125 253.164500 and i know that that is a is a concern and if those people aren't willing to
Customer 248.304000 261.077750 [silence]
Agent 253.164500 258.262750 go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is
Agent 258.262750 261.966625 what what was paid is almost wasted
Customer 261.077750 263.103750 yeah really
Agent 261.966625 265.801250 and uh well i mean i guess you can't ever totally say that but
Customer 263.103750 268.776250 [silence]
Agent 265.801250 276.673500 you know the best good was not gleaned from the [laughter-money] [laughter-spent] where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess
Customer 268.776250 271.050625 right yeah
Customer 271.050625 275.739125 [silence]
Customer 275.739125 278.200500 yeah do you uh
Agent 276.673500 278.533375 need
Customer 278.200500 284.632625 does your husband's company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits
Agent 278.533375 285.878875 [silence]
Customer 284.632625 307.546750 [silence]
Agent 285.878875 290.179500 well yes i guess so you know uh
Agent 290.179500 293.842000 but not uh not really
Agent 293.842000 305.415500 you know there're there are some options in in every area whether it's medical or uh you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings
Agent 305.415500 310.501625 kind of plan that's subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so
Customer 307.546750 309.119750 right
Customer 309.119750 318.552375 yeah that's one thing i wish that we had was like a 401K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals
Agent 310.501625 314.626000 [silence]
Agent 314.626000 317.855000 um-hum yeah yeah
Agent 317.855000 324.572250 yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we uh
Customer 318.552375 328.320250 [silence]
Agent 324.572250 330.078750 uh that that's what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so
Customer 328.320250 330.360500 yeah
Agent 330.078750 332.538250 you know it's good that
Customer 330.360500 335.635250 that or retire i don't think we can plan on social security taking care of us so
Agent 332.538250 334.015625 [silence]
Agent 334.015625 341.954375 no i don't think so i think there're going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly
Customer 335.635250 362.815250 [silence]
Agent 341.954375 350.324750 even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for
Agent 350.324750 354.157750 hopefully we won't have such a attitude
Agent 354.157750 360.049875 in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to
Agent 360.049875 363.335000 lend a hand by the time we get there [laughter-too]
Customer 362.815250 369.296750 yeah with what they say about how the population's changing i think attitudes'll have to change to go along with that
Agent 363.335000 365.816000 [silence]
Agent 365.816000 367.097250 yeah
Agent 367.097250 368.219000 [silence]
Agent 368.219000 373.094250 exactly so it's going to we're going to see a lot of changes in the next while
Customer 369.296750 371.474500 [silence]
Customer 371.474500 377.180125 and that'll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and
Agent 373.094250 374.284500 [silence]
Agent 374.284500 377.960250 i would think so don't you think yeah
Customer 377.180125 379.478625 they'll need more health care
Agent 377.960250 386.428125 i know uh my mother-in-law has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and she's seventy two
Customer 379.478625 385.683000 [silence]
Customer 385.683000 387.024000 so
Agent 386.428125 394.395750 and uh it's just been so difficult to get uh you know to get anything
Customer 387.024000 393.368125 [silence]
Customer 393.368125 394.944000 yeah
Agent 394.395750 395.942625 but uh
Customer 394.944000 398.665500 does that just supplement like Medic[are]- Medicare or
Agent 395.942625 397.192125 [silence]

Customer 408.516000 419.672250 yeah that's good see i my husband been self-employed and he's worked for uh like a small companies and now he's in a little bit bigger company so we've seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have
