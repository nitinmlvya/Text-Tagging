Agent 89.522500 97.871750 [silence]
Customer 95.087125 99.014000 uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate

Agent 105.085875 114.553500 reduce the our expenditures for defense course we've got to get get this big debt that the country has under control
Agent 114.553500 121.665375 and if as we get that under control then i'd like to see the taxes that we pay reduced
Agent 121.665375 132.510125 a certain amount you know so that we're all comfortable but i do believe that the country's gonna have to get itself straightened out {debtwise} before uh they could do too much that way

Agent 148.352125 154.912750 [silence]
Agent 154.912750 169.688125 yes it it it seems as though a lot of the things that we see in the paper and in letters that you receive are showing you loopholes or how not to pay your share and that really is sort of against what the whole ball game's about isn't it
