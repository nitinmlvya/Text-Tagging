Agent 0.000000 1.128375 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 1.995625 [noise] do you use credit cards
Agent 1.128375 4.016750 convenience uh [laughter]
Customer 1.995625 3.357750 it
Customer 3.357750 11.423625 [silence]
Agent 4.016750 12.028375 i- i use them_1 for j[ust]- uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard
Customer 11.423625 12.723250 do you
Agent 12.028375 19.245750 but um i- i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um
Customer 12.723250 34.575750 [silence]
Agent 19.245750 20.312000 [silence]
Agent 20.312000 26.614375 [noise] uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one
Agent 26.614375 38.785500 uh has a twenty doll[ar]- it's a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i- i pay off every month
Customer 34.575750 36.083375 uh-huh
Customer 36.083375 40.153875 [silence]
Agent 38.785500 40.978125 there's no interest charge
Customer 40.153875 41.873750 i see
Agent 40.978125 42.020750 [silence]
Customer 41.873750 46.288625 [silence]
Agent 42.020750 46.971250 but and we never carry over we pay off every month
Customer 46.288625 53.576375 what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you don't pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa
Agent 46.971250 52.767500 [silence]
Agent 52.767500 60.866625 well one thing is whenever we rent a car we don't have to pay um any extra insurance
Customer 53.576375 85.176125 [silence]
Agent 60.866625 68.157125 so that we uh my husband's uh family lives in New Hampshire
Agent 68.157125 70.445625 and uh
Agent 70.445625 74.041625 it's about_1 ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston
Agent 74.041625 78.997375 so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car
Agent 78.997375 85.829125 so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card
Customer 85.176125 86.955000 i see
Agent 85.829125 104.628250 [silence]
Customer 86.955000 90.967875 i see we used to get the American Express card and
Customer 90.967875 100.118125 stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um
Customer 100.118125 105.418000 benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so
Agent 104.628250 105.986750 um-hum
Customer 105.418000 110.346375 uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we don't do
Agent 105.986750 109.758500 [silence]
Agent 109.758500 111.107125 um-hum
Customer 110.346375 119.274500 or other types of services i'm sure there're some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh i've just wondered what they were they haven't been appealing to us so far
Agent 111.107125 118.441250 [silence]
Agent 118.441250 129.569500 no uh unless there's some no i the[re's]- n[o]- uh unless there's some advantage there's not any point th[ere's]- there's no prestige [laughter-factor] [laughter-involved]
Customer 119.274500 127.636750 [silence]
Customer 127.636750 139.326750 yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know you've arrived you've got this card
Agent 129.569500 131.959750 [laughter]
Agent 131.959750 138.745625 [silence]
Agent 138.745625 140.126000 uh-huh
Customer 139.326750 141.327875 and uh
Agent 140.126000 144.304375 [silence]
Customer 141.327875 149.591125 you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh
Agent 144.304375 145.825750 oh dear
Agent 145.825750 147.476125 [silence]
Agent 147.476125 148.772500 yeah
Agent 148.772500 153.631750 [silence]
Customer 149.591125 162.741750 so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i don't know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the V[isa]- Visa and [laughter-MasterCard] and they said fine we'll give it to you anyway
Agent 153.631750 155.018500 um-hum
Agent 155.018500 160.124250 [silence]
Agent 160.124250 161.710375 yeah
Agent 161.710375 163.814250 uh-huh
Customer 162.741750 164.573500 and we said you know
Agent 163.814250 165.393500 yeah
Customer 164.573500 177.801000 we're uh we're not interested in your card anymore and they said well wait a minute i[s]- is it the price [laughter-and] [laughter-we] said yeah so well we won't charge anymore [laughter] you know and they used to charge what eighteen dollars a year or something like that twelve dollars something like that
Agent 165.393500 169.274125 [silence]
Agent 169.274125 171.373000 yeah uh-huh
Agent 171.373000 172.921625 uh-huh
Agent 172.921625 175.982500 [silence]
Agent 175.982500 176.988125 yeah
Agent 176.988125 178.174250 uh-huh
Customer 177.801000 179.607500 so
Agent 178.174250 187.276625 [silence]
Customer 179.607500 188.194625 they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and
Agent 187.276625 188.770000 um
Customer 188.194625 191.854875 it's wonderful in that respect and we're glad to have them_1 we we
Agent 188.770000 190.400125 [silence]
Agent 190.400125 192.817375 can can you buy groceries with it
Customer 191.854875 193.411750 yeah
Agent 192.817375 195.432750 uh-huh yeah
Customer 193.411750 204.055125 it's great you know and it eventually what we're gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and it'll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i don't think the Discover card's gonna make it in the long term
Agent 195.432750 197.880375 [silence]
Agent 197.880375 199.323375 um-hum
Agent 199.323375 203.654750 [silence]
Agent 203.654750 205.176250 um-hum
Customer 204.055125 213.218625 um you know we don't need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but it'll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because_1 the price will come down
Agent 205.176250 211.203500 [silence]
Agent 211.203500 213.496000 yeah i think so too
Customer 213.218625 215.732500 i don't think it's worth fifty five bucks a year
Agent 213.496000 214.948500 [silence]
Agent 214.948500 216.643625 no it's not
Customer 215.732500 221.430875 when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and they're pitching that in all their commercials i notice
Agent 216.643625 219.977125 [silence]
Agent 219.977125 224.030000 yeah you really can and uh also um
Customer 221.430875 231.798250 [silence]
Agent 224.030000 226.764250 we travel abroad
Agent 226.764250 228.018750 some
Agent 228.018750 235.094625 and um it um you get MasterCard's accepted everywhere and and you get the
Customer 231.798250 233.133625 yeah
Customer 233.133625 236.397875 [silence]
Agent 235.094625 241.993375 a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in traveler's checks of course there are
Customer 236.397875 237.773250 yeah
Customer 237.773250 240.682500 [silence]
Customer 240.682500 247.654875 well n[ow]- now that's interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the [vocalized-noise] conversion fee probably
Agent 241.993375 247.023750 [silence]
Agent 247.023750 253.879000 yeah and and even uh converting your traveler's checks at a bank they still charge you a fee
Customer 247.654875 253.008000 [silence]
Customer 253.008000 254.235250 right
Agent 253.879000 255.454625 and uh
Customer 254.235250 260.946125 well it it's gonna come that way and the reason it's nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources
Agent 255.454625 272.460500 [silence]
Customer 260.946125 266.113000 anywhere in the world and that's where we're headed [noise] the technology supports that nicely
Customer 266.113000 275.261000 and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen
Agent 272.460500 273.801125 um-hum
Agent 273.801125 278.492750 [silence]
Customer 275.261000 283.653875 and you don't get uh anything charged to you and that's great it's just insurance we're very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them
Agent 278.492750 281.414500 yeah um-hum um-hum
Agent 281.414500 283.279250 [silence]
Agent 283.279250 284.734625 yeah
Customer 283.653875 286.996000 it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever
Agent 284.734625 286.352750 [silence]
Agent 286.352750 287.606875 yeah
Customer 286.996000 292.397375 [noise] um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA
Agent 287.606875 291.160500 [silence]
Agent 291.160500 293.935625 yeah we do too [laughter]
Customer 292.397375 297.986000 yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh [noise] that's a great thing f[or]-
Agent 293.935625 297.986000 [silence]
