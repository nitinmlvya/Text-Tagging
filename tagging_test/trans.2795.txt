Agent 0.000000 0.992875 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.413125 [noise]
Customer 0.413125 1.468125 [silence]
Agent 0.992875 63.581750 [silence]
Customer 1.468125 4.719250 the basic question is too much
Customer 4.719250 6.245125 and
Customer 6.245125 17.784625 i don't know my my opinion i guess here in North Carolina they announced that May second was the uh tax day that's when you everything you've earned so far has gone to taxes
Customer 17.784625 20.255500 the rest of the year is yours
Customer 20.255500 24.951125 that represents about a third of your income
Customer 24.951125 30.090500 and i don't know uh who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third
Customer 30.090500 36.826250 but uh i i don't know i find myself in a position sort of like selective
Customer 36.826250 44.616500 approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh don't agree with some of them
Customer 44.616500 46.249125 and
Customer 46.249125 49.795375 i think that we could have less tax
Customer 49.795375 52.034750 by cutting out some of the
Customer 52.034750 53.493125 the uh
Customer 53.493125 56.005125 programs that we support
Customer 56.005125 63.762125 but overall i guess we're pretty fortunate nature nation as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay how do you feel
Agent 63.581750 71.200500 well i i've lived overseas you know it's with in the Army and i see what kind of taxes they pay in other countries
Customer 63.762125 71.960750 [silence]
Agent 71.200500 92.453875 [silence]
Customer 71.960750 80.988250 yeah i've done some business overseas in in Latin America and of course know about the we hear about Sweden with their
Customer 80.988250 91.326625 uh social program but you don't hear what the cost is same in Eur[ope]- in Britain and other nations much higher tax rates
Customer 91.326625 93.993375 but the
Agent 92.453875 94.376750 it just seems as if
Customer 93.993375 109.755500 [silence]
Agent 94.376750 95.866125 [silence]
Agent 95.866125 104.670125 from the time i've been following politics which was i guess about seventy five really got interested in politics and keeping up with it
Agent 104.670125 110.915375 it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control
Customer 109.755500 111.359625 oh yes
Agent 110.915375 113.800125 and then they scream about that
Customer 111.359625 119.956750 [silence]
Agent 113.800125 120.516250 that or the uh politicians scream about they're going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year
Customer 119.956750 131.628250 oh yes that that's the uh the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or or cutbacks or
Agent 120.516250 220.208125 [silence]
Customer 131.628250 135.922875 uh equating it to a personal income situation
Customer 135.922875 140.842375 and yet it's almost automatic or it's hidden and
Customer 140.842375 145.959750 uh i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do
Customer 145.959750 147.438875 [silence]
Customer 147.438875 151.911000 the one of the other problems that i have recently is
Customer 151.911000 158.092750 centered on such things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta Georgia to play golf
Customer 158.092750 163.384000 and i realize that constant communication is necessary
Customer 163.384000 168.070500 especially when Bush had his uh
Customer 168.070500 172.027250 heart rhythm problem this weekend but
Customer 172.027250 178.153000 we can always send jets for someone i think if if they're out of pocket
Customer 178.153000 182.955750 rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip
Customer 182.955750 184.234000 [silence]
Customer 184.234000 190.420500 so that's what i meant about the selectives some things i think we're doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money
Customer 190.420500 193.043625 but other things uh
Customer 193.043625 201.105125 like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think it's one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see
Customer 201.105125 209.347500 kids of uh any background roaming through and seeing such great collections
Customer 209.347500 210.495625 [silence]
Customer 210.495625 211.724375 but
Customer 211.724375 216.342000 then when when we talk about all the foreign aid that we give away
Customer 216.342000 218.749875 that bothers me a lot
Customer 218.749875 220.034250 [silence]
Customer 220.034250 227.571000 i don't know how to solve the problem though when as you said the uh bureaucracy gets out of hand regardless of who you vote for
Agent 220.208125 221.568875 [noise]
Agent 221.568875 231.505500 [silence]
Customer 227.571000 230.206000 the bureaucracy continues too
Customer 230.206000 242.220250 [silence]
Agent 231.505500 239.827000 i i have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign i understand going into countries where they've had natural disasters
Agent 239.827000 243.354250 and going in and giving relief aid that way
Customer 242.220250 243.606125 uh-huh
Agent 243.354250 248.773625 but paying for their these countries to run their own governments
Customer 243.606125 248.380875 [silence]
Customer 248.380875 250.435375 oh i think it's way
Agent 248.773625 251.571625 i i've got a big hang-up with that
Customer 250.435375 255.563375 it's way out of hand i'm almost turning into an isolationist [laughter]
Agent 251.571625 272.812000 [silence]
Customer 255.563375 266.136625 which is not not a good attitude in in global uh communications and everything that we have this these days but it's a matter of uh
Customer 266.136625 271.918625 i hate to see money thrown away and that's what i re[ally]- i equate to some of our foreign aid policies
Customer 271.918625 279.426250 [silence]
Agent 272.812000 278.076500 it just seems like they keep saying we're helping this country or we're helping that country out
Agent 278.076500 279.631250 [silence]
Customer 279.426250 280.703375 and they
Agent 279.631250 283.004375 wouldn't our money be better spent helping here at at home
Customer 280.703375 281.936250 [silence]
Customer 281.936250 284.349500 i agree i think that's
Agent 283.004375 291.222125 [silence]
Customer 284.349500 291.300750 i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare
Agent 291.222125 297.880750 that's something i would and that subject in itself i'd love to see that entire thing revised
Customer 291.300750 296.668750 [silence]
Customer 296.668750 307.554250 oh yeah yeah i i think when you get to a point where it's more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job you've got a basic concept problem
Agent 297.880750 306.612500 [silence]
Agent 306.612500 308.463375 something's got to change
Customer 307.554250 308.815875 yeah
Agent 308.463375 310.462250 you know and turn drastically
Customer 308.815875 309.990500 [silence]
Customer 309.990500 315.775875 but i i think uh if we're going to waste money i'd almost see rather see us waste it at home [laughter]
Agent 310.462250 361.312875 [silence]
Customer 315.775875 320.149625 than overseas too and that there's some unusual
Customer 320.149625 324.133125 things which can occur in the foreign aid uh
Customer 324.133125 331.484750 by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and that's a lot of power vested in one
Customer 331.484750 335.330125 one person in our system of uh
Customer 335.330125 337.079000 governance
Customer 337.079000 339.332375 and i've seen that happen
Customer 339.332375 344.100750 over the last few years and you and i are paying for it
Customer 344.100750 345.979625 [silence]
Customer 345.979625 351.890500 but Jim it comes back a lot to the same thing that you said initially you've been overseas and have seen
Customer 351.890500 354.044500 other places
Customer 354.044500 358.440875 and i guess we're still fortunate but i think we're ju[st]- i just want us to be smarter
Customer 358.440875 360.036500 than we are
Customer 360.036500 368.118750 [silence]
Agent 361.312875 362.840375 well we've got
Agent 362.840375 364.648875 [silence]
Agent 364.648875 369.611000 it's not like this country doesn't have the people with the knowledge we've got it
Customer 368.118750 369.462875 uh-huh
Customer 369.462875 386.114375 [silence]
Agent 369.611000 373.354750 we've got people that are willing to make change
Agent 373.354750 381.751000 but as long as you've got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington
Agent 381.751000 387.016875 playing power broker they're not going to do anything to t[ap]- tap out the well
Customer 386.114375 394.054750 yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term
Agent 387.016875 409.278875 [silence]
Customer 394.054750 395.648875 no let's see
Customer 395.648875 398.428500 i forget was it one term or two term
Customer 398.428500 400.647125 fixed
Customer 400.647125 406.584000 uh incumbency in other words they can't be reel[ected]- reelected after
Customer 406.584000 409.052625 i think maybe the second term
Customer 409.052625 413.390125 [silence]
Agent 409.278875 416.257125 now that's something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too
Customer 413.390125 414.794875 federal
Customer 414.794875 415.879000 [silence]
Customer 415.879000 417.187125 yeah
Agent 416.257125 419.001500 two terms then they got to sit out one
Customer 417.187125 419.170875 [silence]
Agent 419.001500 453.165375 [silence]
Customer 419.170875 426.101125 yeah i think it takes away the issue of of a lot of the uh special lobbyist groups and everything else
Customer 426.101125 428.816875 creating the incumbent uh
Customer 428.816875 429.821625 [silence]
Customer 429.821625 431.013125 about
Customer 431.013125 434.580375 invincib[ility]- invincibility
Customer 434.580375 436.062250 but
Customer 436.062250 441.487000 there's another problem with that i'd we've got some good ones and i hate to see them leave [laughter]
Customer 441.487000 445.017875 but it i guess it's hard to to really uh
Customer 445.017875 448.180750 identify which are the good and which are the bad
Customer 448.180750 451.778250 the electorate seems to be putting them all back in
Customer 451.778250 452.800625 [silence]
Customer 452.800625 457.245125 and i thought this last election would be different but it it turned out it really wasn't
Agent 453.165375 454.558250 and i think
Agent 454.558250 457.801125 [silence]
Customer 457.245125 479.755375 [silence]
Agent 457.801125 469.651875 the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesn't matter if they're in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine they're going to be able to do things behind the scenes
Agent 469.651875 471.070250 [silence]
Agent 471.070250 475.079000 either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in
Agent 475.079000 476.829875 [silence]
Agent 476.829875 482.837750 working within their party of of the state or national level to get things enacted
Customer 479.755375 481.170875 uh-huh
Customer 481.170875 484.258875 [silence]
Agent 482.837750 485.397375 that's not going to slow them down at all
Customer 484.258875 489.514875 uh it doesn't solve the non elected bureauc[rats]- bureaucrats either that's
Agent 485.397375 518.782250 [silence]
Customer 489.514875 494.143625 that's an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit
Customer 494.143625 498.714500 in the same position and really don't give a hoot who gets elected
Customer 498.714500 503.605625 they still kind of run the show and and setup all the roadblocks and the
Customer 503.605625 505.555125 the uh
Customer 505.555125 509.498625 horrendous regulations and everything else
Customer 509.498625 512.200125 but it's uh
Customer 512.200125 517.093125 it's our system i think now we have to figure out how to really manage it well
Customer 517.093125 524.332375 [silence]
Agent 518.782250 525.778500 i think compared to the other systems that are out there without a doubt we've got probably the best system it just needs some fine tuning
Customer 524.332375 527.956750 uh-huh uh-huh i think that's right
Agent 525.778500 529.120875 [silence]
Customer 527.956750 529.606500 well
Agent 529.120875 535.076625 well the question is wh[o]- who's ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt
Customer 529.606500 533.849375 [silence]
Customer 533.849375 539.035500 yeah How do you feel about the information we get uh
Agent 535.076625 573.465875 [silence]
Customer 539.035500 544.488500 from Congress that that affects us as far as the uh
Customer 544.488500 547.511875 knowledge to to elect the right people
Customer 547.511875 548.734875 [silence]
Customer 548.734875 552.081875 i have i have a real problem federal register for instance
Customer 552.081875 553.324500 [silence]
Customer 553.324500 557.369875 uh you can have almost put anything in there you want to
Customer 557.369875 562.045875 no it's not in the federal register what's the uh the congressional record
Customer 562.045875 570.707750 uh someone can put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something or uh
Customer 570.707750 592.005625 [silence]
Agent 573.465875 575.135000 trying to get
Agent 575.135000 576.166750 [silence]
Agent 576.166750 577.590875 the um
Agent 577.590875 578.633750 [silence]
Agent 578.633750 582.059125 politicians to actually truthfully
Agent 582.059125 589.595125 report what they did vote for what they didn't vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk
Agent 589.595125 590.599375 [silence]
Agent 590.599375 593.412500 is almost is going to be impossible to do
Customer 592.005625 593.637750 yeah it
Agent 593.412500 595.591375 there is no accountability of them
Customer 593.637750 594.764750 [silence]
Customer 594.764750 595.984000 and
Agent 595.591375 598.894000 at any given time if you've been to Washington
Customer 595.984000 598.894000 [silence]
