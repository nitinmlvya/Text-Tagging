Customer 104.691750 110.348250 [silence]
Agent 110.320500 112.387875 you know so that it it's
Customer 110.348250 111.597500 that's true

Agent 130.975125 137.208125 [silence]
Customer 136.482125 139.506375 they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there
Agent 137.208125 138.595125 yeah
Agent 138.595125 144.558125 but uh you know you find it's uh that the uh the interest rates vary so much on those that uh
Customer 139.506375 142.359000 [silence]
Customer 142.359000 144.162875 uh-huh uh-huh
Customer 144.162875 150.058625 [silence]
Agent 144.558125 153.114125 that we've been paying real close attention to that so we're using the ones that uh have the lower rate as a matter of fact the uh the uh credit union
Customer 150.058625 151.448500 that's good
Customer 151.448500 152.368000 [silence]

Customer 166.864125 176.172500 don't pay us too much you know and they drop it your balance uh they drop your monthly payment down low because they want that interest to build up
Agent 173.684875 175.040500 uh-huh
Agent 175.040500 176.363000 right
Customer 176.172500 181.027000 so that's what i normally try to do if it's pretty low i try to make a couple payments at a time
Agent 176.363000 177.307000 [noise]

Agent 183.356375 184.375625 [silence]
Agent 184.375625 189.972000 so you haven't been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then
Customer 184.998625 190.142875 [silence]

Customer 200.612875 202.848750 i don't understand how they do that
Agent 202.052625 208.706000 and uh of course it's a nine hundred number which that means they're going to charge you you know fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call
Customer 202.848750 205.399875 [silence]
Customer 205.399875 206.646250 right

Agent 208.706000 210.503875 [silence]
Agent 210.503875 217.897750 well the thing is th[e]- that a lot of those are like they're set up through a bank or a savings and loan type thing
Customer 211.023125 216.716500 [silence]
Customer 216.716500 217.985875 uh-huh

Customer 252.696625 253.962250 uh-huh
Agent 253.416750 262.383625 but i didn't use them we we usually spend cash you know pay cash for gas and then uh most of the places will take uh the Visa card anyway so
Customer 253.962250 256.448000 [silence]
Customer 256.448000 257.725000 right

Agent 268.883500 270.248875 [laughter]
Customer 269.498875 282.956625 or at least not enough you know to fill a tank up so i always almost always use my credit card on that on that and then it's nice you do tend to pay more for gas but other than that it's it's a good deal i think
Agent 270.248875 275.119875 [silence]
Agent 275.119875 276.365500 yeah
Agent 276.365500 278.635250 [silence]

Agent 302.531250 303.968875 but uh
