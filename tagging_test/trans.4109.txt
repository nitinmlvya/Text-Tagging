Customer 43.452250 47.861500 Saturday you you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday
Customer 47.861500 56.198375 and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that'd happen is that for every four people we'd give another job

Agent 56.074375 57.468750 right
Customer 56.198375 66.627250 and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market we'd have uh
Agent 57.468750 77.940250 [silence]
Customer 66.627250 77.997125 more recreation people would have time to do it there'd be less of a stress level we'd have le[ss]- we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons we'd nee[d]- you know less police force
Agent 77.940250 87.113875 yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it's not clear in that
Customer 77.997125 85.951250 [silence]
Customer 85.951250 95.237500 it it that's that's that's a that's a possibility one o[f]- one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance

Agent 100.853250 102.448125 uh-huh
Customer 101.028875 109.518250 and it it it's too costly and then what i[s]- what is happening is that they're on um
Agent 102.448125 128.494125 [silence]
Customer 109.518250 123.106125 a policy where they have s[o]- X amount of of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and
Customer 123.106125 125.043500 and and things like that
Customer 125.043500 134.305750 what happen[s]- and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a a group well what'll what happens then is that

Customer 138.611000 143.363625 so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything
Agent 143.022375 144.402000 um-hum
Customer 143.363625 149.530500 so what they do is is that they they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage
