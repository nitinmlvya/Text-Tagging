Agent 0.000000 8.019000 [noise] we're supposed to talk about if we agree on if we're paying too many taxes or if we're getting our monies worth out of the taxes we pay
Customer 0.000000 1.107625 [noise]
Customer 1.107625 7.187750 [silence]
Customer 7.187750 17.088250 right i think it's kind of a loaded question i don't think anybody would say we should pay more [laughter-i] [laughter-think] i think most of us feel that we do pay enough
Agent 8.019000 12.604625 [silence]
Agent 12.604625 14.156500 no
Agent 14.156500 16.382250 [silence]
Agent 16.382250 31.306000 yeah i think here in Texas they're even running an ah a series right now on the news one of the news channels at night about they were like secretly um supervising people that were supposed to be working for a county here
Customer 17.088250 30.833625 [silence]
Customer 30.833625 32.356625 um-hum
Agent 31.306000 36.251625 and they were hired by the st[ate]- state so they were being paid with our tax money
Customer 32.356625 35.502875 [silence]
Customer 35.502875 36.849000 right
Agent 36.251625 42.823250 [noise] and they weren't even doing the job they were out working on other sites not doing a thing on what they were supposed to do
Customer 36.849000 42.727875 [silence]
Customer 42.727875 55.370000 [noise] well i- i think what's happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that once they get them they're entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions etcetera
Agent 42.823250 54.844500 [silence]
Agent 54.844500 56.135750 right
Customer 55.370000 65.274875 uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job and when i came in i'm i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me
Agent 56.135750 82.962875 [silence]
Customer 65.274875 68.619875 and i found people sitting around me polishing their nails and
Customer 68.619875 81.467000 they were downright disgusted with me because i was going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didn't like me you know showing them up and finishing stuff so what they did was give me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do
Customer 81.467000 95.731875 so i would just back off bu[t]- and you know that's what it seemed like from the inside um it's not that no one works i think what happens is it's a personality thing and those who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four freeloaders
Agent 82.962875 84.607250 right
Agent 84.607250 95.311375 [silence]
Agent 95.311375 96.583875 yeah
Customer 95.731875 103.936500 who don't do it i th[ink]- i- i you know i think it's a cross section of humanity it's not so much all state workers i mean it's hard to generalize like that
Agent 96.583875 102.735375 [silence]
Agent 102.735375 114.682375 yeah i think that we pay enough taxes and i think that if if everybody would be honest with how they dealt with the tax money if we could somehow get the same um ability to
Customer 103.936500 176.647000 [silence]
Agent 114.682375 121.540750 get work done and and be honest about it with our tax dollars i don't think they need to raise it and i think they'd be able to
Agent 121.540750 130.835000 handle with what we've got i feel like here in Texas we pretty much get our monies back out of what we pay i feel very pleased with what they do they've put in
Agent 130.835000 137.120875 you know as far as the state taxes go i don't know about our federal money i think that's all pretty [laughter]
Agent 137.120875 145.382625 i hope that they're doing better with not spending so much more than what they've got but you know you just never you can't control that but in the state here
Agent 145.382625 154.158500 they've put in bike trails they've got really nice parks here in Texas they keep their their their lots that they own that are green and stuff they keep them_1 really nice
Agent 154.158500 159.342250 um their schools here are really good and updated they've got computers in the schools
Agent 159.342250 170.397625 i'm very pleased at least with the area that we're in with how they spend their money their their they don't tax us outrageously and they seem to really give us a lot for our tax dollars
Agent 170.397625 177.318000 they offer community classes for our kids to go to that are just very mi[nimal]- minimal costs you know just cover the instructor
Customer 176.647000 178.810250 oh
Agent 177.318000 191.552250 and um there lots of opportunities that you can take advantage of there are community colleges here you can take for just practically nothing um they just offer so much for i feel like what we pay in our taxes that i don't mind paying them at all
Customer 178.810250 189.959500 [silence]
Customer 189.959500 198.737500 apparently there's been a uh movement where i am i'm on Long Island which is a suburb of N[ew]- New York City
Agent 191.552250 214.217500 [silence]
Customer 198.737500 210.509625 and um there's been a movement by home owners to try get their their home taxes reduced they feel their too high and there's all kind of review boards that if you feel strongly about it you can challenge your tax
Customer 210.509625 221.278125 uh the newspapers now running an article on state universities which you know everyone kind of ass[ume]- at least i did assume that you can get a good education and pay so much less than a private University
Agent 214.217500 215.602750 um-hum
Agent 215.602750 234.097500 [silence]
Customer 221.278125 234.185375 and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and fi[ve]- like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class they're so over crowded they can't get in the class
Agent 234.097500 235.612250 [noise] yeah
Customer 234.185375 241.125125 so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class
Agent 235.612250 240.314875 [silence]
Agent 240.314875 241.796000 right
Customer 241.125125 249.238875 that th[is]- this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well that's that's an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads
Agent 241.796000 260.295125 [silence]
Customer 249.238875 260.926125 but some of these people are you know from India and Asia and they don't speak English well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent
Agent 260.295125 261.825625 right
Customer 260.926125 266.301500 and and i heard that that's true i mean that's i find that incredible that's a [vocalized-noise]
Agent 261.825625 265.032000 [silence]
Agent 265.032000 269.464000 so you're not as pleased with your tax dollars and what they're doing in New York
Customer 266.301500 267.341250 [silence]
Customer 267.341250 272.176500 uh yeah well i guess i have a a private um
Agent 269.464000 286.514250 [silence]
Customer 272.176500 287.091500 ar[gument]- argument with them i'm a substitute teacher who you know have have has raised a family my kids are older now and i'd like to work full-time and they're firing teachers left and right and the classes are getting bigger our school budgets are really down
Agent 286.514250 287.735750 yeah
Customer 287.091500 291.603750 maybe it's not handled real efficiently you know that's that's very likely
Agent 287.735750 289.743500 [silence]
Agent 289.743500 292.901375 [vocalized-noise] that could be i don't know um
Customer 291.603750 299.458000 my you know my husband's in the computer business and the schools just you know they're updating computers are the hot new thing and my husband was
