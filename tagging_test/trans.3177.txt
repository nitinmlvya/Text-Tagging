Agent 0.000000 0.529500 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.040000 [noise]
Customer 0.040000 8.368625 does tend to get [noise] talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how they're collected
Agent 0.529500 32.200250 [silence]
Customer 8.368625 16.167375 is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does
Customer 16.167375 27.846250 enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are
Customer 27.846250 33.377000 uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and
Agent 32.200250 38.489875 but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments
Customer 33.377000 35.067750 [silence]
Customer 35.067750 36.358000 well i think
Customer 36.358000 37.966375 [silence]
Customer 37.966375 45.136000 i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right
Agent 38.489875 44.569625 [silence]
Agent 44.569625 46.864625 but we don't have that anymore do we
Customer 45.136000 46.273375 i
Customer 46.273375 49.638500 no not uh not near to the extent that it was
Agent 46.864625 48.910250 [silence]
Agent 48.910250 53.585125 i didn't think so they've even cut you know who can have an IRA
Customer 49.638500 53.124250 [silence]
Customer 53.124250 54.234750 right
Agent 53.585125 66.086375 that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now they've cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair
Customer 54.234750 65.729750 [silence]
Customer 65.729750 78.719750 right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good in[centive]- good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of
Agent 66.086375 91.094375 [silence]
Customer 78.719750 91.352000 uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way
Agent 91.094375 97.161125 but they already tax us i mean where we live [noise] it's eight almost eight and a half percent tax
Customer 91.352000 92.368500 people
Customer 92.368500 94.078375 [silence]
Customer 94.078375 95.271875 well
Customer 95.271875 96.666500 [silence]
Customer 96.666500 106.415250 right but couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there
Agent 97.161125 112.700375 [silence]
Customer 106.415250 113.108000 and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make
Agent 112.700375 115.943375 oh and then some [laughter] and then some
Customer 113.108000 114.034500 [silence]
Customer 114.034500 115.347000 and then some
Customer 115.347000 118.528500 so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing
Agent 115.943375 132.042000 [silence]
Customer 118.528500 132.887750 uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year you'd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing
Agent 132.042000 136.126500 are you talking about doing away with income tax
Customer 132.887750 135.544500 [silence]
Customer 135.544500 140.674875 doing away with everything except for yeah all f[orms]- all forms of it including
Agent 136.126500 139.530250 [silence]
Agent 139.530250 140.717875 i don't think
Customer 140.674875 146.922250 [silence]
Agent 140.717875 147.190250 well we're already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i don't think that would generate enough money
Customer 146.922250 150.501500 well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent
Agent 147.190250 149.694000 [silence]
Agent 149.694000 156.010500 oh i see what you're saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um
Customer 150.501500 152.960750 yeah so if you took the money out of one
Customer 152.960750 165.687000 [silence]
Agent 156.010500 166.435250 off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period
Customer 165.687000 173.058375 well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage
Agent 166.435250 172.919500 [silence]
Agent 172.919500 177.614000 well if they're not reporting the income now they're still not paying it so what's the point
Customer 173.058375 174.176000 if if
Customer 174.176000 176.250500 [silence]
Customer 176.250500 182.994875 well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money
Agent 177.614000 187.671125 [silence]
Customer 182.994875 188.044875 you know pays taxes or not but he's going to have to pay that percentage see what i'm saying
Agent 187.671125 188.853500 no
Customer 188.044875 193.820000 well when a guy comes in to you know he's got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries
Agent 188.853500 193.431625 [silence]
Agent 193.431625 194.201875 um-hum
Customer 193.820000 196.604250 he pays fifteen percent tax let's say
Agent 194.201875 196.261375 [silence]
Agent 196.261375 197.236250 right
Customer 196.604250 201.606875 and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax
Agent 197.236250 201.089125 [silence]
Agent 201.089125 202.039500 right
Customer 201.606875 206.511875 so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it
Agent 202.039500 205.971125 [silence]
Agent 205.971125 207.285000 right
Customer 206.511875 212.030250 and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased
Agent 207.285000 220.665125 [silence]
Customer 212.030250 213.941750 because_1 the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him
Customer 213.941750 219.756375 whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong
Customer 219.756375 221.589000 [silence]
Agent 220.665125 230.042625 oh i see what you're saying but if we had to have an income tax which they're never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay
Customer 221.589000 223.040000 see so i'm saying there's
Customer 223.040000 237.517000 [silence]
Agent 230.042625 237.950000 what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPA's and
Customer 237.517000 239.728750 right [laughter] right
Agent 237.950000 242.411125 H&R Blocks would be out of [laughter] of a job but uh
Customer 239.728750 241.732375 so you you tax
Customer 241.732375 248.090500 yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it
Agent 242.411125 244.150625 [silence]
Agent 244.150625 245.176875 yeah
Agent 245.176875 247.125750 [silence]
Agent 247.125750 250.348500 i never have understood why they don't do that
Customer 248.090500 250.121125 [silence]
Customer 250.121125 251.949625 yeah it it does seem
Agent 250.348500 254.119750 and no one can explain it [laughter-to] [laughter-me]
Customer 251.949625 253.220000 [silence]
Customer 253.220000 258.249875 it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they
Agent 254.119750 260.918375 [silence]
Customer 258.249875 261.655000 they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them_1 anymore
Agent 260.918375 262.609875 no no
Customer 261.655000 263.373500 [silence]
Agent 262.609875 263.680375 [silence]
Customer 263.373500 264.506500 so
Agent 263.680375 268.232125 [noise] i don't know i- i guess there's never a an answer nobody ever asks
Customer 264.506500 268.072125 [silence]
Customer 268.072125 273.993000 that's true that's true not being an economy major i guess they'd never ask me anyway
Agent 268.232125 270.120250 [laughter]
Agent 270.120250 273.204625 [silence]
Agent 273.204625 276.674875 [laughter] they don't ask me at all [laughter]
Customer 273.993000 276.165500 [noise]
Customer 276.165500 277.099250 oh
Agent 276.674875 290.048750 i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because_1 some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they don't pay anything
Customer 277.099250 289.064000 [silence]
Customer 289.064000 290.334750 right
Agent 290.048750 295.964250 and i question their i- i- i just think that they've made it almost a joke
Customer 290.334750 299.522000 [silence]
Agent 295.964250 299.522000 all the deductions in the the way you can sen[d]-
