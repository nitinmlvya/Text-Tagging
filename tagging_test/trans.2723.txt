Customer 170.375750 171.756500 right
Agent 171.295375 175.151750 but the most important thing was that uh they had
Customer 171.756500 186.048500 [silence]
Agent 175.151750 178.547375 made up the difference between
Agent 178.547375 183.967500 uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay

Customer 218.617500 223.604000 he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too
Agent 223.229750 228.325875 well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh
Customer 223.604000 228.462875 [silence]

Agent 246.328375 250.361125 [silence]
Agent 250.361125 252.799125 well that's one of those little uh
Customer 250.457375 257.017750 [silence]

Customer 267.276000 271.872750 [silence]
Agent 269.795250 277.433750 since i'm only a yellow badger i won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned
Customer 271.872750 273.170875 um-hum
Customer 273.170875 274.806625 [silence]
Customer 274.806625 276.171125 right
Customer 276.171125 277.188750 [silence]
Customer 277.188750 286.090000 what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a 401[K]- account i i've been thinking about that for years uh
Agent 277.433750 284.947750 [silence]
Agent 284.947750 287.797625 i've never heard of such a thing
Customer 286.090000 297.333000 i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested
Agent 287.797625 296.745750 [silence]
Agent 296.745750 298.210750 um-hum
Customer 297.333000 301.610625 and then just add the money together like you do with a 401[K]- account you know
Agent 298.210750 301.575625 [silence]
Agent 301.575625 302.878625 uh yeah
Customer 301.610625 307.026250 uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over
Agent 302.878625 305.293250 [silence]
Agent 305.293250 308.586250 i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didn't know there was such a thing
Customer 307.026250 308.133000 [silence]
Customer 308.133000 317.981000 no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
Agent 308.586250 321.429625 [silence]
Customer 317.981000 323.233125 i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a company seven years
Agent 321.429625 326.147000 yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security
Customer 323.233125 325.736875 [silence]
Customer 325.736875 335.003750 uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current
Agent 326.147000 347.015500 [silence]
Customer 335.003750 338.996625 like when say we retire after the year two thousand
Customer 338.996625 342.856000 social security's paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel
Customer 342.856000 351.245375 and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know
Agent 347.015500 348.408750 yeah yeah
Agent 348.408750 352.299500 [silence]
Customer 351.245375 352.830250 that's just a thought i mean i
Agent 352.299500 357.280250 uh-huh no i i like the idea course that's that's some something like an IRA
Customer 352.830250 354.314750 if they say which
Customer 354.314750 355.511375 yeah
Customer 355.511375 356.930250 [silence]
Customer 356.930250 365.622875 yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know
Agent 357.280250 365.492125 [silence]
Agent 365.492125 367.141125 uh-huh
Customer 365.622875 369.082250 but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because
Agent 367.141125 376.649625 [silence]
Customer 369.082250 373.931750 the statistics are you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know

Customer 391.230625 397.685625 you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together
