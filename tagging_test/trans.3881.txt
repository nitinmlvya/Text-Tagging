Agent 1.352000 4.730625 [silence]
Agent 4.730625 15.587625 i think that uh one of the things they're going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at what's important and what has a return on investment
Customer 5.008875 24.720000 [silence]
Agent 15.587625 19.625500 uh there's an awful lot of federal programs that uh
Agent 19.625500 25.200250 they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good
Customer 24.720000 30.331250 right i- i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at
Agent 25.200250 30.383625 [silence]
Customer 30.331250 58.368125 [silence]
Agent 30.383625 35.732250 and there's some things some programs that just don't seem to be working at all
Agent 35.732250 43.801625 uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs they're just seem to be self perpetuating
Agent 43.801625 45.554125 and uh
Agent 45.554125 50.426625 uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved
Agent 50.426625 59.019500 just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them_1 no incentive whatever to to solve their own problems
Customer 58.368125 65.338625 right people get get where they depend on the the benefit and they don't have much interest and there is no uh
Agent 59.019500 74.110500 [silence]
Customer 65.338625 74.120125 uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesn't get continued there's there's a lot of waste as a result i think of that
Agent 74.110500 78.100000 well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh
Customer 74.120125 85.988125 [silence]
Agent 78.100000 86.460750 they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family
Customer 85.988125 86.996875 yeah
Agent 86.460750 94.056125 so that's resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare
Customer 86.996875 93.375375 [silence]
Customer 93.375375 94.848750 yeah
Agent 94.056125 101.823375 and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around
Customer 94.848750 101.649625 [silence]
Customer 101.649625 103.251375 well uh i
Agent 101.823375 105.148250 and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing
Customer 103.251375 104.884750 [silence]
Customer 104.884750 114.879125 yeah i think there's uh there's a good opportunity if they'll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh
Agent 105.148250 139.786875 [silence]
Customer 114.879125 118.991125 if and combine the savings there with with the savings in
Customer 118.991125 130.837500 all these uh give away programs and and then waste that's in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just
Customer 130.837500 140.161875 continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that don't do any good
Agent 139.786875 146.210250 i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation
Customer 140.161875 145.986375 [silence]
Customer 145.986375 151.292125 well there was a there was a study i don't know if you heard of it it was the Grace Commission

Agent 152.140000 166.357625 [silence]
Customer 160.486000 168.787875 i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on
Agent 166.357625 167.569625 yeah
Agent 167.569625 169.110375 [silence]

Agent 169.110375 171.514250 well i know that uh
Agent 171.514250 180.624250 well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator
Agent 180.624250 184.995250 and work out a a one or two page cost proposal
Customer 184.166250 185.605500 uh-huh
Agent 184.995250 189.118750 and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program
Customer 185.605500 196.375625 [silence]
Agent 189.118750 198.584750 we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh of nonsense to for somebody to go read
Customer 196.375625 204.217875 right yeah you wonder if all that is necessary and that's the same in government i guess it's is it all necessary

Customer 209.412500 214.459375 yeah yeah it it perpetuates a lot more jobs i think is what it does
Agent 209.788000 210.927250 [laughter]
Agent 210.927250 211.979250 and
Agent 211.979250 216.254625 [silence]
Customer 214.459375 216.416875 [silence]
Agent 216.254625 224.777625 uh and i- i think one of the problems we're having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh
Customer 216.416875 217.975250 but but
Customer 217.975250 232.494875 [silence]
Agent 224.777625 233.083875 when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor
Customer 232.494875 234.042000 uh-huh

Customer 246.252000 258.212875 well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and that's something the government has never really tried hard to do uh
Agent 246.732125 263.925500 [silence]
Customer 258.212875 264.693875 they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have
Agent 263.925500 264.929750 um-hum
Customer 264.693875 273.129625 uh there's no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when you're going into debt to do it
Agent 264.929750 273.070250 [silence]
