Agent 49.597250 51.620875 [noise] so what do you do
Customer 51.069125 57.948000 [noise] well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so
Agent 51.620875 65.397375 [silence]
Customer 57.948000 65.974750 we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
Agent 65.397375 66.754750 um-hum
Customer 65.974750 69.652500 and then we divvy them up between
Agent 66.754750 72.105875 [silence]
Customer 69.652500 82.106625 our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week
Agent 72.105875 74.127375 [laughter-wow]
Agent 74.127375 82.109875 [silence]
Customer 82.106625 85.858375 and so that does help that helps a lot
Agent 82.109875 83.472000 yeah
Agent 83.472000 90.526000 [silence]
Customer 85.858375 94.321875 and then um we don't have a lot ex[tra]- extra for extra spending so it's pretty well [laughter] earmarked
Agent 90.526000 96.824375 [laughter-yeah] all allocated out [laughter] yeah
Customer 94.321875 102.857375 yeah [laughter] ev[ery]- every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and
Agent 96.824375 117.858000 [silence]
Customer 102.857375 108.323375 and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we
Customer 108.323375 118.406875 found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all
Agent 117.858000 119.132625 all the
Customer 118.406875 126.397500 um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or
Agent 119.132625 121.090250 checks yeah
Agent 121.090250 125.861500 [silence]
Agent 125.861500 129.002125 right yeah we found that um

Customer 129.572625 135.200500 [silence]
Agent 133.675750 143.690500 the unnecessary expenses [laughter] we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh
Customer 135.200500 137.354625 that's true
Customer 137.354625 148.474000 [silence]
Agent 143.690500 146.199625 money for things that
Agent 146.199625 156.779000 you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh
Customer 148.474000 150.184750 uh-huh
Customer 150.184750 152.551125 [laughter]
Customer 152.551125 160.615750 [silence]
Agent 156.779000 161.525750 thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early
Customer 160.615750 162.288125 yeah
Agent 161.525750 164.626500 because of this and and stuff like that so
Customer 162.288125 163.958750 [silence]
Customer 163.958750 166.242250 well it helps you to focus
Agent 164.626500 167.815125 [silence]
Customer 166.242250 173.408250 where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the s[ame]- the same frustration before you got on a budget but
Agent 167.815125 169.762625 yeah [laughter]
Agent 169.762625 179.522625 [silence]
Customer 173.408250 183.941125 you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go
Agent 179.522625 182.915375 that's a lot of money but [laughter]
Agent 182.915375 184.676375 yeah
Customer 183.941125 188.981125 huh and also we have found that if we write down
Agent 184.676375 185.764750 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 185.764750 199.033250 [silence]
Customer 188.981125 198.090375 a[nd]- and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know
Customer 198.090375 199.587500 every paycheck
Agent 199.033250 200.328750 um-hum
Customer 199.587500 204.737125 and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see
Agent 200.328750 210.822000 [silence]
Customer 204.737125 211.046625 [noise] just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's
Agent 210.822000 211.999500 [noise]
Customer 211.046625 213.660625 we should because_1 it does help
Agent 211.999500 213.022125 [silence]
Agent 213.022125 217.815500 yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if
Customer 213.660625 220.009250 [silence]
Agent 217.815500 226.816500 you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to [laughter-uh] uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh
Customer 220.009250 221.537500 uh-huh
Customer 221.537500 222.589375 [laughter]
Customer 222.589375 232.009750 [silence]
Agent 226.816500 235.221500 um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a
Customer 232.009750 233.704000 uh-huh
Customer 233.704000 235.457125 [noise]
Agent 235.221500 242.483000 in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount
Customer 235.457125 240.001125 [silence]
Customer 240.001125 241.272500 [vocalized-noise]
