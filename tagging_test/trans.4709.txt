Agent 59.597250 66.737500 you you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them
Customer 61.274625 75.405375 [silence]
Agent 66.737500 76.091000 and having to cover your own medical and uh you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your of your compensation package

Agent 175.853000 177.136000 right
Agent 177.136000 179.490250 [silence]

Customer 179.838375 182.555625 [silence]
Customer 182.555625 190.654750 it really did it's it started i think a little bit before that but that when P I E and and Ryder went together why
Agent 183.555875 193.664500 [silence]
Customer 190.654750 193.968625 it was downhill from then on you know
Agent 193.664500 205.939000 yeah and the the problem with that is you know when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time but when when the company goes bankrupt i mean the they're just cut off completely and you're responsible for your own
Customer 193.968625 199.735375 [silence]
Customer 199.735375 201.236500 right
Customer 201.236500 206.604875 [silence]

Customer 209.225000 217.139125 yes it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits we could do that for eighteen months
Agent 209.970000 216.323375 [silence]
Agent 216.323375 217.685625 right
Customer 217.139125 221.679250 but three hundred and fifty dollars a month God that's terrible
Agent 217.685625 221.353750 [silence]
Agent 221.353750 223.493750 it's definitely excessive
Customer 221.679250 222.727875 [silence]
Customer 222.727875 229.421250 you know so but anyhow uh and jobs aren't that hard to find
Agent 223.493750 231.816625 [silence]
Customer 229.421250 235.366375 to get another one that does pay your benefits you know and a lot of them_1 that if you do get a job they don't pay benefits

Customer 246.140000 247.883125 um-hum
Agent 247.125250 253.945000 and the the short-term disability policy is is a ninety day policy and there is no long term disability policy
Customer 247.883125 253.354750 [silence]
Customer 253.354750 255.247125 um
Agent 253.945000 260.173000 so you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there
Customer 255.247125 258.740375 [silence]
Customer 258.740375 260.803125 um-hum um-hum
Agent 260.173000 264.022250 and you know of course they can use the excuse well we're a start-up
Customer 260.803125 263.595375 [silence]
Customer 263.595375 265.600875 yeah right
Agent 264.022250 282.940750 [silence]
Customer 265.600875 276.301125 but you know what's happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things God there's been big articles in the paper about that
Customer 276.301125 285.984250 uh you know they claim a back injury and then someone goes out and spies on them and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else you know
Agent 282.940750 284.480500 right
Agent 284.480500 290.319875 [silence]
Customer 285.984250 291.072875 so i don't know what's happening and what's going to happen but uh
Agent 290.319875 293.890125 well that certainly doesn't help matters any i mean you
Customer 291.072875 298.522625 [silence]
Agent 293.890125 299.458000 you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you you know these additional benefits su[ch]-
Customer 298.522625 299.458000 um
