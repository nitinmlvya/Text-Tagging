Agent 0.000000 37.170500 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 3.664125 the uh whole savings and loan thing seems to be uh
Customer 3.664125 12.305875 a bit of a system whereby the the natural human greed was able to flourish and some people were able to do some things that
Customer 12.305875 22.767250 that uh they they felt that that since the government was backing them_1 they could just uh go ahead and make these transactions and make these loans and get all this money as it were
Customer 22.767250 36.679125 and it was rather difficult to catch all if if any of the people that were really responsible for it and even those who were caught didn't seem to get get much in the way of punishment as far as getting a restitution made
Customer 36.679125 46.139000 so it just seems like a a really set up you know the whole thing was set up to to be abused and so human nature did so
Agent 37.170500 38.641000 yeah i think the
Agent 38.641000 43.569750 [silence]
Agent 43.569750 44.811500 oh yeah
Agent 44.811500 45.924750 [silence]
Agent 45.924750 59.278625 yeah i think the government is it's own worst enemy about the time it was all going on they were trying to run a loose monetary policy anyhow to stimulate the economy and plus they had cut back on the way of government regulators to even investigate or keep a watchdog on the whole industry
Customer 46.139000 134.551625 [silence]
Agent 59.278625 67.508875 and uh i think the whole economic situation was set up to uh put the savings and loans in the position they were in and they mainly the banks too
Agent 67.508875 74.593875 uh economically we had gotten into pretty unsound conditions and so the idea of trying to make the money supply good and loose
Agent 74.593875 81.965875 via whatever medium whether it be savings and loans or banks either one was the order of the day [noise] so needless to say they did
Agent 81.965875 90.236000 and uh since they didn't really regulate it well or watch it well uh by cutting back on uh government uh uh
Agent 90.236000 99.750125 uh monitoring in that respect then it did get out of hand and you're right you're absolutely right there were some people who saw the situation for what it was and they took advantage of it
Agent 99.750125 107.040875 and uh because of it you and i are the main taxpayers now are going to have to pay not only for the burden of the bad investments that they made
Agent 107.040875 115.727625 but we're going to have to pay for the uh mistakes in the uh uh taking advantage of the system to some of these well really when you get right down to it crooks
Agent 115.727625 119.503750 uh uh took advantage of the system with
Agent 119.503750 126.706125 and yeah they've seem to caught a few i i've heard on TV or read in uh the newspaper about a couple of these guys i forget the
Agent 126.706125 130.133625 the name of one of them but i heard that they did uh [noise]
Agent 130.133625 135.505500 prosecute him and maybe a couple of others i think you all had a major crisis down there in Texas right
Customer 134.551625 137.965000 yeah there were quite a few down here mainly by
Agent 135.505500 155.207500 [silence]
Customer 137.965000 151.776625 just because of the sheer numbers that were here as of you know the and the chances of getting a bad one would be greater just out of the sheer population of them being here and the whole problem seemed to start start toward uh
Customer 151.776625 162.608375 not that California was the instigator of it but it seemed to start out that way and then then work its way here and it wasn't kind of funny that it wasn't a national problem until it hit the east coast
Agent 155.207500 156.290250 yeah
Agent 156.290250 162.583250 [silence]
Agent 162.583250 166.011000 yeah that's always interesting isn't it see he's right
Customer 162.608375 170.764125 you [laughter-know] when it started hitting the big New York banks and the up then it became a nationwide problem and Congress got to do something but
Agent 166.011000 167.860500 oh yeah
Agent 167.860500 176.011625 [silence]
Customer 170.764125 177.127000 uh Texas is on basically on the way to recovery as far as uh the banking industry goes and they
Agent 176.011625 187.221000 oh i'm glad to hear that because_1 i've been concerned that the banks may be going the same direction that the savings and loans primarily because uh what got the savings and loans in trouble is the same sort of things that's beginning to get the banks in trouble
Customer 177.127000 207.362250 [silence]
Agent 187.221000 195.299125 [noise] and that was uh the real estate uh backing in investment and just building in general backing contractors and those kinds of uh corporations
Agent 195.299125 207.941000 uh who were trying to build a lot of uh uh rental business space and uh mall type space and things like that and uh it looked like in the seventies that that was going to be a real booming thing uh a infinitum i guess
Customer 207.362250 208.540875 um-hum
Agent 207.941000 214.411625 and uh anybody if they just stop and use a little common sense would realize well you just can't soak up this much real estate
Customer 208.540875 223.754750 [silence]
Agent 214.411625 224.049125 uh and continue to have this kind of growth indefinitely i mean you you it's it's like anything eventually reach sort of a plateau where you've overbuilt if you're not careful
Customer 223.754750 224.870000 right
Agent 224.049125 230.239875 uh and uh it it's as if uh they they went crazy just just like in gambling almost
Customer 224.870000 230.043500 [silence]
Customer 230.043500 231.350625 um-hum
Agent 230.239875 232.713500 and th[ere]- there was no
Customer 231.350625 287.459375 [silence]
Agent 232.713500 235.118000 regulation or anything like that uh
Agent 235.118000 242.110250 i- i frankly though a[nd]- a[nd]- i'm glad to hear you say what you said about Texas because_1 i have been concerned that the banking system
Agent 242.110250 243.150250 [silence]
Agent 243.150250 246.054750 uh which is going through some economic difficulty now
Agent 246.054750 255.056500 and with all the foreign investments that they uh put money into also [noise] i i've i've been concerned that the banking system is going to find itself in dire straits
Agent 255.056500 260.216250 or if they even didn't find themselves in dire straits we're going to find ourselves with so much of our money
Agent 260.216250 271.201000 uh lent out to foreign owners who are willing to soak up some of this this uh capital to keep us afloat you might say hoping to make a buck off of us in interest in the future
Agent 271.201000 279.121125 that uh we find our own economi[c]- economy even though it may not have slipped into so so some kind of either deflationary or inflationary depression
Agent 279.121125 280.997125 uh we find ourselves having
Agent 280.997125 287.962875 sold out our futures in terms of what we are going to have to pay off all this debt with to foreign investors who have the money to build to buy up all the debt
Customer 287.459375 288.466125 um-hum
Agent 287.962875 301.390125 and uh i'm glad to hear that you do you know uh how uh they're beginning to get over the feet in Texas are are is a lot of the money in loans and and the like that uh uh is that being covered by foreign investments maybe or or uh
Customer 288.466125 299.982250 [silence]
Customer 299.982250 310.148125 well part of the problem as i see it uh my family's involved in [laughter] in both industries as it were i've i've got a grandfather that was in the
Agent 301.390125 307.101625 [silence]
Agent 307.101625 308.454875 um-hum um-hum
Agent 308.454875 312.919000 [silence]
Customer 310.148125 316.596625 S and L back in the sixties and the seventies and in another part of Texas and in a uh
Agent 312.919000 314.420875 okay
Agent 314.420875 341.670750 [silence]
Customer 316.596625 317.373000 my
Customer 317.373000 321.268000 immediate parents were both in banking as it were and so uh we've
Customer 321.268000 330.629250 we've kept up with the industry as it were and the the feeling has been in some of the discussions that that get started on that topic has been that
Customer 330.629250 342.384125 you know we went through the the bad times of a number of bad loans and fortunately the the banks and the S and Ls that uh our family were associated with really didn't have that much problem they were fairly conservative and
Agent 341.670750 342.990125 um-hum
Customer 342.384125 349.308875 they just had to ride out the storm with the the reputational problems that came with the the news media as it were and
Agent 342.990125 346.632500 [silence]
Agent 346.632500 347.892125 yeah
Agent 347.892125 374.768000 [silence]
Customer 349.308875 350.583125 uh
Customer 350.583125 362.475875 there were a number of banks that made the bad loans and basically it's been a good weeding out process there's just been a lot of people a lot of banks a lot of whole organizations that were going to make these kinds of loans
Customer 362.475875 363.868250 and
Customer 363.868250 376.482500 and they are no longer in business uh so you know you you have some all your bank failures that the government's having to take over you know that's gone up in the hundred and twenty or thirty or so for the state
Agent 374.768000 377.230500 yeah it's been quite a few every year
Customer 376.482500 381.664125 yeah and that's pretty well leveled off and and the that's
Agent 377.230500 380.246375 [silence]
Agent 380.246375 383.527625 well do you think maybe it's peaked you think yeah
Customer 381.664125 385.618125 yeah yeah i don't think there's going to be that many more of them_1 i- i would
Agent 383.527625 384.636250 [silence]
Agent 384.636250 393.065375 so y[ou]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you would uh predict based on at least your knowledge and experience that in time we'll see the numbers of banks and maybe savings and loans too if they're still failing
Customer 385.618125 400.223500 [silence]
Agent 393.065375 394.203000 uh
Agent 394.203000 401.297375 that that that the the number beginning to sort of taper off now instead of a hundred to two hundred a year you begin to see it go down to maybe fifty to a hundred a year and maybe
Customer 400.223500 402.694750 right right there's just not that many m[ore]-
Agent 401.297375 403.952875 what kind of [vocalized-noise] time fr[ame]- frame would you
Customer 402.694750 407.603750 [silence]
Agent 403.952875 406.086500 guess that's going to take
Agent 406.086500 408.072125 to wring itself out
Customer 407.603750 418.613125 well it's hard to say how many more bad bad systems or bad apples there are out in the system but i would i'd be willing to bet that uh it shouldn't be more than a couple more years tha[t]- that
Agent 408.072125 417.309000 [silence]
Agent 417.309000 422.388375 oh you think two years i- i would have guessed five to ten but you really think two years
Customer 418.613125 420.049625 [silence]
Customer 420.049625 421.424000 well the
Customer 421.424000 427.894250 as far as as far as not having this getting over this peak as it is now uh there's still going to be an unusual
Agent 422.388375 425.380750 [silence]
Agent 425.380750 426.670500 uh-huh uh-huh
Agent 426.670500 436.155250 [silence]
Customer 427.894250 437.276625 you know it depends on how far back you want to go let's say if you went back ten years and said here's a failure rate we could live with well then it may take us three to five years to get back to that level of failure
Agent 436.155250 437.395375 oh okay
Customer 437.276625 445.688125 but if you want to just say we're over the hump and we're starting to get better i think in a couple of years it'll be quite obvious that we're over the hump and getting better
Agent 437.395375 445.135875 [silence]
Agent 445.135875 450.002250 well tell me w[ell]- all this all these bad loans and debts that
Customer 445.688125 455.024625 [silence]
Agent 450.002250 455.342000 uh i- i know in the case of the savings and loans we're just going to have to pick it up as American taxpayer
Customer 455.024625 456.282500 um-hum
Agent 455.342000 461.521875 but even the banks and the likes some so some of those are merging and uh uh the the
Customer 456.282500 470.167875 [silence]
Agent 461.521875 465.079750 the the basic question i'm trying get to is all this bad money
Agent 465.079750 467.527625 that's essentially not going to get paid back
Agent 467.527625 469.299500 how's it going to get covered
Agent 469.299500 471.993750 [silence]
Customer 470.167875 472.778875 i'm not sure if uh
Agent 471.993750 480.467750 i mean is inflation going to make some of it go away and the rest of it we're going to pick up the tab as taxpayers or are we going to be able to sell some of these bad loans or pick them up somehow or another
Customer 472.778875 511.075500 [silence]
Agent 480.467750 487.435875 uh uh by foreign investors uh buying pieces of our our economy like buying some of our been to some of our banks uh
Agent 487.435875 495.456250 like the things that uh i forget the guy's name downtown here uh was involved in uh those two banks i think that was in Georgia or someplace
Agent 495.456250 507.077125 uh what what what how do see that this this indebtedness of which is bad loans and the like just not going to get paid back at least by the people who caused the debt
Agent 507.077125 518.516750 uh you you can't just write that off completely you can write off a certain part of it i guess but you just can't just write off the whole somewhere along the line you've got to recoup some of that money some of the even if it's twenty five to fifty cents on the dollar
Customer 511.075500 512.266500 right
Customer 512.266500 520.089000 [silence]
Agent 518.516750 520.433875 ho[w]- ho[w]- how's that going to happen
Customer 520.089000 526.797500 well like one guy i heard just talking earlier this week on the topic was saying that that there wasn't any one given
Agent 520.433875 552.154375 [silence]
Customer 526.797500 528.452250 uh you know sort of like a uh
Customer 528.452250 533.634750 s[uit]- guy making a uh suit for you it it's custom made to the individual situation if you
Customer 533.634750 538.658875 you don't try to find well write off all these to the government or have have the
Customer 538.658875 553.520500 the entire uh bank failure covered by the government so you you take each individual situation yeah and if you can find a foreign investor or if you can find any investor that'll that'll finance i guess that's what the majority of the uh RTC is doing is trying to
Agent 552.154375 553.417125 uh-huh
Agent 553.417125 559.466375 [silence]
Customer 553.520500 561.128500 to resolve all these individual cases in any way possible i mean they're looking for
Agent 559.466375 570.135875 how good a job do you think they're doing because_1 you know there's been quite a bit in the various news magazines up here and even the Washington Post and various places about uh how they felt that the uh the people on the committee
Customer 561.128500 581.832375 [silence]
Agent 570.135875 582.573000 were sort of selling out at uh ex[orbitantly]- exorbitantly low prices to some rather astute investors some of this had been misinter[preted]- who were tending the who were really tend to make the nice killing off that how do you how do you feel about that
Customer 581.832375 596.738375 well i was i was talking with another gentleman about that same topic it's hard to get a feel for what's going on in a nationwide uh system like that when the news media reports the segments that they report you know you hear
Agent 582.573000 594.485875 [silence]
Agent 594.485875 597.321125 yeah mainly they look for the the wild news
Customer 596.738375 599.050875 yeah you hear things like uh th[e]-
Agent 597.321125 599.050875 [silence]
