Customer 33.349750 40.461125 [silence]
Agent 36.146750 42.401375 to do also is to discriminate as to uh which should be taxed and what shouldn't be taxed so

Customer 183.392875 184.547500 uh-huh
Customer 184.547500 185.567500 [silence]
Customer 185.567500 193.591750 yeah yeah now we lived in Houston for a while in the [vocalized-noise] and in in the city was pretty pretty pretty rough in places
Agent 188.327375 189.962750 uh-huh
Agent 189.962750 191.944125 [silence]
Agent 191.944125 193.220375 right
Agent 193.220375 207.636625 right yeah so um i i don't know i'm uh i'm really glad that they didn't go to the um the the state income tax um i'm hoping the lottery is going to uh take care of it uh i know there's a lot of religious issues and et cetera
Customer 193.591750 194.870000 yeah
Customer 194.870000 204.064250 [silence]
Customer 204.064250 205.458625 yeah
Customer 205.458625 223.871500 [silence]
Agent 207.636625 214.243750 um but i i'm hoping that uh in a way people can can see that as a contribution then to the state
Agent 214.243750 224.790875 um i did live in Ohio for a couple of years and i know that's how they kind of got around um you know having to uh taxes or increase in taxes was was by the lottery
Customer 223.871500 226.160125 is that right yeah
Agent 224.790875 234.959875 yeah yeah and and i know the people are concerned that it's only gonna be the the lower you know income people who are actually going to you know be the the biggest participants in this um
Customer 226.160125 232.727500 [silence]
Customer 232.727500 240.117125 yeah so some of those folks probably say you're taxing them_1 anyway then if you're dangling a lottery out there in front of them_1 yeah
Agent 234.959875 235.962250 [silence]
Agent 235.962250 237.937375 right
Agent 237.937375 246.833000 yeah yeah ab[solutely]- absolutely and um i only saw it as being you know really positive and of course it you know was just a fluke if you won
Customer 240.117125 241.405000 hum
Customer 241.405000 252.367125 [silence]
Agent 246.833000 256.763375 you know because_1 i really never expected to win and and i never did the big big lottery we're talking about uh but you know every once in a while i'd come up with two or three dollars or something but
Customer 252.367125 253.640625 yeah
Customer 253.640625 256.027375 [silence]
Customer 256.027375 257.433875 uh-huh

Customer 257.433875 262.405375 [silence]
Customer 262.405375 263.861000 uh-huh

Agent 284.232625 285.625625 [noise]
Agent 285.625625 288.409125 [silence]
