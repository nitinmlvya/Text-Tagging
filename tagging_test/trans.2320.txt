Agent 220.187125 223.996875 uh well they ha[ve]- we have direct deposit that helps a lot
Customer 220.684500 223.275750 [silence]
Customer 223.275750 224.357125 uh-huh
Agent 223.996875 226.384375 uh and uh

Customer 241.845375 242.857250 uh-huh
Customer 242.857250 259.084500 [silence]
Agent 245.228875 249.605750 uh you know that's extra uh but

Customer 259.084500 260.215000 uh-huh
Agent 259.812000 269.098875 and uh none of them's ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and uh
Customer 260.215000 266.806750 [silence]
Customer 266.806750 268.059500 uh-huh
Customer 268.059500 283.427625 [silence]
Agent 269.098875 271.522875 it works out real well uh
Agent 271.522875 274.410000 most problem we had was when uh
Agent 274.410000 276.184500 let's see when was it
Agent 276.184500 279.328625 something like we had a three p[ay]- uh weekends
Agent 279.328625 284.413375 uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period
Customer 283.427625 284.718250 uh-huh
Agent 284.413375 288.025375 and uh we was close to being uh
Customer 284.718250 311.082750 [silence]
Agent 288.025375 294.488000 oh shoot i'm trying to think it's been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh
Agent 294.488000 300.022750 it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away
Agent 300.022750 303.548750 uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff
Agent 303.548750 306.356750 and so that was pretty bad but
Agent 306.356750 310.568000 i don't know i like that he's got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard
Agent 310.568000 313.812625 [silence]

Agent 315.555000 317.789750 yeah pretty much uh
Customer 315.594750 323.943750 [silence]
Agent 317.789750 318.858125 [silence]
Agent 318.858125 323.633250 with the direct deposit that's what helps you know because he doesn't have the money in hand
Agent 323.633250 331.448375 [silence]
Customer 323.943750 332.178875 yeah if if if you don't have to go down to the bank for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well i'll take five or ten dollars here
Agent 331.448375 336.546125 oh well he's he's we got that ATM machine and that and his bank is right there at his work

Customer 387.880875 391.924500 between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does
Agent 391.639875 398.254125 yeah that's what's going to hurt us in April uh we owe on our taxes and that will hurt

Agent 412.128750 419.663125 [silence]
Customer 413.783250 417.289750 however i guess it uh beats the alternative
Customer 417.289750 418.295500 [silence]
Customer 418.295500 420.150875 just not having anything to start out with
