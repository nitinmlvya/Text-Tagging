Agent 89.362000 103.340875 so i[t]- um they're not i don't think they're quite as bad as they are in New York state i guess is my opinion right now um there is like there are there's a tax on food here which is you know a little bit different because_1 they don't have that up there
Agent 103.340875 108.709625 a[nd]- and other than that right now they're starting to realize that their taxes are low
Agent 108.709625 122.269125 but they also realize that they still have to make sure their roads are paved and so on so they're starting to talk about um raising like instead of registering or uh getting your license which costs five dollars now they decide to well maybe we should charge forty dollars for it
