Customer 211.399625 223.157750 i don't think so as a matter of fact i've only been with the company a month and a half and uh i i asked my boss i think we do have a Christmas party although he indicated the budget is kind of low
Agent 212.061000 215.018250 [silence]
Agent 215.018250 216.235000 oh
Agent 216.235000 221.797000 [silence]

Customer 223.157750 224.288375 [laughter]
Agent 224.261625 233.799125 [silence]
Customer 224.288375 234.663000 but then with just uh ten of us in the office you know as far as a company picnic or anything i don't think that there's enough of us you know to to get together and do something like that
Agent 233.799125 235.253000 huh
Customer 234.663000 236.804375 but uh
Agent 235.253000 251.165250 [silence]
Customer 236.804375 245.418375 uh the office is pretty free you know as far as if i decide that i want to go out to lunch with someone and i'm late coming back
Customer 245.418375 251.865000 no one complains or says anything about it and if i need some time off to go to a doctor they wouldn't penalize me for that
Agent 251.165250 259.026000 that's good i was yeah oh absolutely i mean the environment you work in is is uh crucial to the job
Customer 251.865000 253.591000 and that counts
Customer 253.591000 258.328000 [silence]
Customer 258.328000 259.520000 um-hum
Agent 259.026000 270.699000 uh we have somewhat we're somewhat in the same situation um i mean i feel i feel odd about taking any personal time anyway unless you know they knew about it or whatever but um
Customer 259.520000 268.504375 [silence]
Customer 268.504375 270.058875 right
Customer 270.058875 276.199500 [silence]
Agent 270.699000 280.745125 but being a sales organization we you know our time is our own i mean we're kind of independent contractors under a common goal type of thing
Customer 276.199500 277.680000 um-hum
Customer 277.680000 292.393250 [silence]
Agent 280.745125 287.650375 so it's kind of the same situation although it sounds like your office structure is more structured as an office time
Agent 287.650375 292.698750 um but you it's not so rigid that you know you punch a clock that type of thing
Customer 292.393250 298.178000 well a lot of it depends on your position too you know other people that are in sales in the office they come and go
Agent 292.698750 298.178000 [silence]
