Customer 97.476000 98.912125 oh
Agent 98.204250 102.393000 and but i think that's more or less kind of in the group insurance field
Customer 98.912125 102.056125 [silence]
Customer 102.056125 103.267375 uh-huh
Agent 102.393000 103.719000 [silence]
Customer 103.267375 105.011000 [silence]
Agent 103.719000 106.561625 so that's a new innovation too for a benefit
Customer 105.011000 111.522000 well that in-house day care is excellent they could go on their lunch hour and see their kids or any time
Agent 106.561625 110.022125 yeah
Agent 110.022125 110.966125 uh-huh

Agent 118.869375 119.895000 [silence]
Agent 119.895000 121.346750 how about uh
Customer 120.741500 126.331000 well i the profit sharing and the retirement they just don't offer those like they used to
Agent 121.346750 126.266250 [silence]
Agent 126.266250 134.941750 yeah in the old days of course they didn't have any any benefits at all they preached job security but that that went out fast
Customer 126.331000 132.428375 [silence]
Customer 132.428375 133.701500 yeah
Customer 133.701500 135.943250 oh it didn't that's right
Agent 134.941750 140.116000 and uh so now days i guess funding takes par[t]- or rather uh
Customer 135.943250 146.909875 [silence]
Agent 140.116000 147.296375 uh your benefits are locked in after you're there with a company for five years but the benefits are so small
Customer 146.909875 147.915250 um-hum
Agent 147.296375 151.045500 and usually they're tied in with social security
Customer 147.915250 152.180000 [silence]
Agent 151.045500 153.416000 and uh it [vocalized-noise]
Customer 152.180000 156.890000 most people retire on social security now that's all they have
Agent 153.416000 155.294250 [silence]
Agent 155.294250 156.372500 yeah
Agent 156.372500 167.936750 right and uh so uh even if you have benefits and you and then when you get to social security age they're not as great because they're tied in to social security benefits so you don't get both of them in full
Customer 156.890000 166.984625 [silence]
Customer 166.984625 168.266125 uh-huh
Agent 167.936750 173.850000 so it's hard today to live off of social security if you don't have your home paid for
Customer 168.266125 173.080750 [silence]
Customer 173.080750 175.231250 that's right that's right

Agent 176.103375 177.397875 so uh
Customer 176.498625 180.394625 that's what my folks did they're just living on social security
Agent 177.397875 192.307250 [silence]
Customer 180.394625 187.751750 [noise] they had [noise] two houses and they were trying to b[uy]- sell one to pay off the other one and

Agent 221.092250 230.596750 going bankrupt and uh so some kind of system has to be devised were more [vocalized-noise] more competitive perhaps we've uh uh
Customer 223.609250 251.111875 [silence]
Agent 230.596750 244.908000 been uh we were too used to off time and all these benefits that are not uh taking care of us in our old age but we're getting immediate effect of them like for example like seven hour days -[a]nd
Agent 244.908000 254.551875 and uh when in effect while we're young we ought to be working harder and come up with better benefits so that when we get older we have the uh
Customer 251.111875 252.430250 um-hum
Customer 252.430250 256.140750 [silence]
Agent 254.551875 260.080250 we we have those benefits available to us in in a need that would make it easy for us in retirement
