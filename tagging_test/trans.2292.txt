Agent 162.271750 163.988250 [silence]
Agent 163.988250 172.192500 the one that's like you get additional they'll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures we just have the basic right now and

Customer 171.203875 189.798125 [silence]
Agent 172.192500 181.021750 for most things it tends to cover it we don't have too many major um expenses at this point but we have been able to find
Agent 181.021750 192.230500 do[ctors]- dentists that will accept [noise] pretty much whatever the basic plan pays a couple of times we've had to pay oh i don't know three to five dollars but that's not that bad
Customer 189.798125 197.926875 uh-huh no that's great yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too
Agent 192.230500 208.208500 [silence]
Customer 197.926875 205.594125 yes and let's see besides insurance other things that we looked at um
Customer 205.594125 215.996125 well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or [laughter-something]
Agent 208.208500 209.485375 um-hum
Agent 209.485375 214.281000 [silence]
Agent 214.281000 217.270750 no we don't like that either [laughter]
Customer 215.996125 227.904750 [noise] so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well he's uh you know he's at the one that's at um
Agent 217.270750 221.982875 [silence]
Agent 221.982875 224.481750 is his office in Plano
Agent 224.481750 229.812625 [silence]
Customer 227.904750 237.835875 seventy five at uh six thirty five and so we[ll]- by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away and
Agent 229.812625 231.756375 uh-huh uh-huh
Agent 231.756375 234.999750 [silence]
Agent 234.999750 236.714000 oh that's not bad
Agent 236.714000 240.791750 [silence]
Customer 237.835875 251.497375 e[specially]- especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting [laughter]
Agent 240.791750 241.987500 right
Agent 241.987500 249.780250 [silence]
Agent 249.780250 252.229000 oh yes you're not kidding
Customer 251.497375 259.257250 and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving
Agent 252.229000 257.771125 [silence]
Agent 257.771125 259.451875 that's right
Customer 259.257250 273.054625 and um so that was something that was important to us and because_1 l[ike]- like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so [laughter-long] that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know
Agent 259.451875 268.252000 [silence]
Agent 268.252000 269.974250 [laughter]
Agent 269.974250 280.257250 [silence]
Customer 273.054625 280.461000 made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and
Agent 280.257250 286.660250 well tha[t]- those are some of the things that are very important to us too um
Customer 280.461000 284.983375 [silence]
Customer 284.983375 286.486625 um-hum
Customer 286.486625 296.252125 [silence]
Agent 286.660250 297.611125 we we'd like you know other benefits that are provided um the athletic facilities that that you can sometimes take advantage of um
Customer 296.252125 297.999625 um-hum
Agent 297.611125 309.494750 i think that's that's pretty nice but i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that but that's a that's a nice benefit to have
Customer 297.999625 308.524250 [silence]
Customer 308.524250 319.728750 um-hum that's true that's really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement
Agent 309.494750 310.946875 [noise]
Agent 310.946875 329.773750 [silence]
Customer 319.728750 327.082875 i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be ha[ving]- having now but when
Customer 327.082875 331.705875 when could uh your salary increase and
Agent 329.773750 331.156375 right
Agent 331.156375 333.303625 [silence]
Customer 331.705875 334.870250 is there was there somewhere to go [laughter]
Agent 333.303625 345.999750 yeah that that's one of the i think the hard things right now i mean they're going through some some tough times [laughter] to say the least uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job [laughter]
Customer 334.870250 338.650375 [silence]
Customer 338.650375 340.739500 um-hum
Customer 340.739500 343.496750 [silence]
Customer 343.496750 347.994625 yes tha[t]- that we can make our mortgage payments and
Agent 345.999750 349.728250 [silence]
Customer 347.994625 350.966500 yeah that's really true
Agent 349.728250 364.496000 uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um [noise] guidelines um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think it's often
Customer 350.966500 373.321250 [silence]
Agent 364.496000 374.997000 in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times [noise]
Customer 373.321250 374.976000 um-hum
Customer 374.976000 382.817500 [silence]
Agent 374.997000 387.979625 smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company it's hard to do that because_1 there're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that
Customer 382.817500 384.487375 um-hum
Customer 384.487375 391.983250 [silence]
Agent 387.979625 393.244250 just one of the things that that happens when someone when you're dealing with a large company
Customer 391.983250 393.980875 uh-huh
Agent 393.244250 394.695125 but
Customer 393.980875 399.351500 but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he
Agent 394.695125 401.739250 [silence]
Customer 399.351500 406.935250 felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for
Agent 401.739250 403.225250 um-hum
Agent 403.225250 410.983875 [silence]
Customer 406.935250 418.979625 for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work everyday and rather than thinking oh i really i can't stand these [laughter-people] [laughter-i] but uh so that's something that was important to him and
Agent 410.983875 413.499500 right [laughter]
Agent 413.499500 421.985000 [silence]
Customer 418.979625 423.470250 thinking he could um work under tho[se]-
Agent 421.985000 424.740375 how long has he been in his present position
Customer 423.470250 429.478375 oh just since l[ast]- last summer it's only been not even a year yet so
Agent 424.740375 425.756000 [silence]
Agent 425.756000 427.499125 uh-huh
Agent 427.499125 429.631250 [silence]
Customer 429.478375 443.479375 [silence]
Agent 429.631250 440.156500 well i was going to say [laughter] it sounds like you you picked out a lot of good things you know for him to to ha[ve]- to uh to choose in a position that has a lot of thought put into it
Agent 440.156500 452.196250 in a big company though you also get moved around a [laughter-lot] he may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some [laughter-time] or or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know [laughter]
Customer 443.479375 445.567750 yes we're
Customer 445.567750 447.097500 [silence]

Agent 452.196250 454.668000 [laughter]
Customer 454.104875 460.311000 i think one of the m[ost]- one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um
Agent 454.668000 462.485250 [silence]
Customer 460.311000 463.497000 my husband was raised in Irving
Agent 462.485250 463.996750 uh-huh
Customer 463.497000 472.997000 and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean it's not that far but
Agent 463.996750 475.486250 [silence]

Agent 475.486250 476.995375 right
Agent 476.995375 489.698125 [silence]
Customer 482.907375 491.485125 we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that
Agent 489.698125 493.494125 yeah we're very
Customer 491.485125 498.754000 so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose TI and chose to move this way
Agent 493.494125 498.475875 [silence]
Agent 498.475875 507.266625 we're very far from our families and it's really hard fam[ilies]- little children and um they were the only grandchildren
