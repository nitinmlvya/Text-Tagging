Customer 4.525000 17.234250 [silence]
Agent 14.143375 17.323250 if you can't pay for it you shouldn't have it period
Customer 17.234250 22.643125 that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans
Agent 17.323250 18.560250 and
Agent 18.560250 19.608375 that's just
Agent 19.608375 22.321875 [silence]

Customer 35.334125 40.507250 but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing
Agent 35.395750 38.444000 [silence]
Agent 38.444000 47.115750 right but that's the problem see as our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that
Customer 40.507250 46.064875 [silence]
Customer 46.064875 54.047000 uh true but uh uh uh without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles or they wouldn't be able to own a house
Agent 47.115750 54.067000 [silence]
Customer 54.047000 115.667375 [silence]
Agent 54.067000 60.885625 yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own
Agent 60.885625 71.746000 or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt
Agent 71.746000 77.100125 then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight
Agent 77.100125 84.204750 if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us
Agent 84.204750 90.668250 that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford
Agent 90.668250 99.279875 which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds
Agent 99.279875 104.930625 but i feel like the generation after us w[ould]- oh man it i would be so good
Agent 104.930625 112.080000 it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with wh[at]- what they could afford to save to buy
Agent 112.080000 115.868125 and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer
Customer 115.667375 122.089750 well now i agree and uh i agree with you one hundred percent i'm just taking the other side just so we'll have a discussion
Agent 115.868125 117.264000 [silence]
Agent 117.264000 118.109875 uh-huh
Agent 118.109875 121.518875 [silence]
Agent 121.518875 124.721250 [laughter]
Customer 122.089750 123.373625 here
Customer 123.373625 131.341875 uh but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile
Agent 124.721250 131.906500 [silence]
Customer 131.341875 139.971500 [silence]
Agent 131.906500 140.887625 but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans
Customer 139.971500 141.427250 um-hum
Agent 140.887625 147.882375 and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it
Customer 141.427250 192.026375 [silence]
Agent 147.882375 159.003000 i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it
Agent 159.003000 168.457125 and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans
Agent 168.457125 173.666500 don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just
Agent 173.666500 184.112625 so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know
Agent 184.112625 192.085250 but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy
Customer 192.026375 193.224875 uh-huh
Agent 192.085250 194.811125 including new vans and so
Customer 193.224875 211.826875 [silence]
Agent 194.811125 198.876625 so i guess i've seen it done and i know you can do it you know
Agent 198.876625 203.737750 but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van
Agent 203.737750 212.319125 and that's where Americans don't like to do it and so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled
Customer 211.826875 215.312375 well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget
Agent 212.319125 215.169250 [silence]
Agent 215.169250 215.778750 what
Customer 215.312375 216.925500 very simple

Agent 234.153500 235.314000 um-hum
Customer 235.117125 240.812125 and that's about uh three or four less than civil servants get
Agent 235.314000 240.218250 [silence]
Agent 240.218250 241.337875 uh-huh
Customer 240.812125 247.054875 now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays
Agent 241.337875 246.542750 [silence]
Agent 246.542750 248.242750 yeah that is true
Customer 247.054875 254.137000 [silence]

Customer 259.654500 261.602750 [silence]
Agent 261.546750 264.091500 [silence]
Customer 261.602750 264.544000 no no they have their own budget they go by
Agent 264.091500 267.660375 but isn't it part of our in[come]- it's not part of our taxes
Customer 264.544000 267.027250 [silence]
Customer 267.027250 271.496875 no you know that's why [vocalized-noise] the price of mailing a letter keeps going up
Agent 267.660375 268.785375 it's not
Agent 268.785375 270.658500 [silence]
Agent 270.658500 273.909500 that's why it keeps [laughter-going] [laughter-up] huh that's another topic
Customer 271.496875 272.531000 [silence]
Customer 272.531000 273.805000 you know i could
Customer 273.805000 278.912000 i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter
Agent 273.909500 274.776375 [laughter]
Agent 274.776375 278.454750 [silence]
Agent 278.454750 280.740875 those stamps are valuable now
Customer 278.912000 280.295875 [silence]
Customer 280.295875 284.184125 yeah [laughter] they probably hey i ought to go looking through some of my old mail
Agent 280.740875 283.836125 [laughter]
Agent 283.836125 289.862625 that's funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that
Customer 284.184125 357.743750 [silence]
Agent 289.862625 296.321375 that overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because
Agent 296.321375 305.649750 i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to
Agent 305.649750 311.842125 be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order
Agent 311.842125 326.099750 and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money sys[tem]- we already have new bills printed for [vocalized-noise] US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean i've seen them_1 [laughter]
Agent 326.099750 334.355000 and so i know that the long-term vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh
Agent 334.355000 340.751375 but i'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know
Agent 340.751375 344.263750 that's a lot of power for one or two people to have
Agent 344.263750 350.793375 and so um i guess because_1 i- i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like
Agent 350.793375 358.465875 you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i don't think Americans are willing to do it
Customer 357.743750 364.595000 well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments
Agent 358.465875 366.286625 [silence]
Customer 364.595000 366.346500 how do you feel about that
Agent 366.286625 372.620750 i don't i don't feel we should loan them money if i- i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things
Customer 366.346500 381.158500 [silence]
Agent 372.620750 382.143000 and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesn't work are they gonna
Customer 381.158500 385.816750 well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a g[ive]- a giveaway
Agent 382.143000 385.085625 [silence]
Agent 385.085625 390.948375 but it's not but it's not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that
Customer 385.816750 466.883375 [silence]
Agent 390.948375 401.285250 i mean our our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them
Agent 401.285250 415.652000 and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation but because we're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back
Agent 415.652000 424.817875 it be do you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but
Agent 424.817875 434.695750 because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things
Agent 434.695750 444.763500 our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back but because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks
Agent 444.763500 448.303625 use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation
Agent 448.303625 451.992125 you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations
Agent 451.992125 459.369000 but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them
Agent 459.369000 466.848875 and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know
Agent 466.848875 468.191375 do you understand
Customer 466.883375 472.322625 no that that's true i- i understand that France still owes us money from World War I
Agent 468.191375 471.561000 [silence]
Agent 471.561000 472.880500 um-hum
Customer 472.322625 479.285500 and uh World War II debts have never been repaid i think the US just wrote them all off
Agent 472.880500 479.283750 [silence]
Agent 479.283750 480.544375 yeah
Customer 479.285500 484.485500 and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that Polish debt here uh last week

Customer 492.989625 511.261125 [silence]
Agent 493.041250 507.942750 right long wh[at]- long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know you can't alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially
Agent 507.942750 509.070875 [silence]
Agent 509.070875 511.820000 that's my opinion my opinion's the latter
