Agent 154.748250 156.270500 um-hum
Agent 156.270500 159.484000 [silence]

Customer 163.810625 173.259500 [silence]
Agent 169.614125 173.840500 they allow you to put into um a certain fund
Customer 173.259500 174.996625 um-hum
Agent 173.840500 185.470375 whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that
Customer 174.996625 190.428500 [silence]
Agent 185.470375 198.670625 any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related
Customer 190.428500 191.987875 uh-huh
Customer 191.987875 203.469250 [silence]
Agent 198.670625 203.976125 and so you claim that amount at the beginning of the year let's say you determine that's five hundred dollars
Customer 203.469250 205.009625 uh-huh
Agent 203.976125 213.004750 they'll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck um broken up into fifty two weeks so whatever that is divided by fifty two
Customer 205.009625 209.744875 [silence]
Customer 209.744875 211.305375 yeah
Customer 211.305375 218.776125 [silence]
Agent 213.004750 219.320000 and w[hat]- what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars
Customer 218.776125 220.489125 yeah
Agent 219.320000 221.255250 do you have something like that
Customer 220.489125 225.491125 no well they may have we just haven't taken advantage of it
Agent 221.255250 224.334125 [silence]
Agent 224.334125 230.997625 it's really wonderful in our case we don't have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim two hundred dollars
Customer 225.491125 228.220500 [silence]
Customer 228.220500 229.495625 uh-huh
Customer 229.495625 230.494875 [silence]
Customer 230.494875 231.667125 yeah
Agent 230.997625 235.797875 so i my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars
Customer 231.667125 235.267375 [silence]
Customer 235.267375 236.993750 right
Agent 235.797875 244.313500 and they break that up into three dollars and eighty five cents a week that's taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for thirty dollars
Customer 236.993750 256.488875 [silence]
Agent 244.313500 257.373625 i pay the thirty dollars and then i send it in to the it's Blue Choice i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for thirty dollars but the nice thing is that that thirty dollars i wasn't taxed on
Customer 256.488875 258.452500 right
Agent 257.373625 266.751750 initially because_1 it it almost looked like i never made that thirty dollars and it's really wonderful if i this is the first year we did it and uh next year
Customer 258.452500 275.983375 [silence]
Agent 266.751750 276.444250 i i'm just going to claim a lot more if you don't spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even two hundred dollars more from it
Customer 275.983375 277.997250 huh so
Agent 276.444250 289.992500 but uh it's a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing
Customer 277.997250 289.291625 [silence]
Customer 289.291625 290.758625 yeah
Agent 289.992500 291.490125 but um
Customer 290.758625 296.229750 so if you don't use it in one year you lose the hum
Agent 291.490125 293.500750 [silence]
Agent 293.500750 302.038875 yes if you don't lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside five hundred dollars and you only spent four fifty
Customer 296.229750 304.229625 [silence]
Agent 302.038875 312.740125 they let you know each quarter and they'll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you haven't spent that fifty then you do lose it
Customer 304.229625 305.721625 yeah
Customer 305.721625 312.715625 [silence]
Customer 312.715625 315.472750 well it's time to go get your teeth cleaned again
Agent 312.740125 314.284250 [silence]
Agent 314.284250 320.043625 yeah right [laughter] or just buy a new set of glasses or [laughter] or whatever
Customer 315.472750 317.731125 [silence]
Customer 317.731125 320.499000 oh yeah that's that's true too
Agent 320.043625 327.497500 but i- i don't know how people can really live on a budget our i mean a budget that's really written out
Customer 320.499000 321.732125 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 321.732125 326.988875 [silence]
Customer 326.988875 328.492000 uh-huh
Agent 327.497500 339.722750 um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean each week is so different some weeks you're just going to go over that and some weeks you're going to go under and so to me it's just easier to
Customer 328.492000 334.292500 [silence]
Customer 334.292500 335.727750 yeah
Customer 335.727750 339.705125 [silence]
Customer 339.705125 351.214375 well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money we're going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it
Agent 339.722750 341.244250 i don't know
Agent 341.244250 343.713250 [silence]

Agent 347.814375 349.194625 right
Agent 349.194625 350.212875 [silence]
Agent 350.212875 353.806750 that's true yeah a very good point
Customer 351.214375 359.737500 so for those people that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at the end of the month and so do we because_1 i hate interest
Agent 353.806750 355.508625 [laughter] yeah
Agent 355.508625 357.246000 [silence]
Agent 357.246000 360.494250 right oh i hate it too
Customer 359.737500 362.994250 so i mean but some people don't care about interest
Agent 360.494250 361.983375 [silence]
Agent 361.983375 370.469000 well you you know some people look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um
Customer 362.994250 368.220250 [silence]
Customer 368.220250 369.737500 yeah
Customer 369.737500 377.497250 [silence]
Agent 370.469000 377.788500 you know if their limit is twenty five hundred dollars if they have a hundred left they'll spend that because they think they have it
Customer 377.497250 378.738625 yeah
Agent 377.788500 382.991000 and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically
Customer 378.738625 382.248000 [silence]
Customer 382.248000 385.265125 right it's a vicious circle
Agent 382.991000 384.011375 [silence]
Agent 384.011375 385.995750 yeah it really is
Customer 385.265125 388.742750 yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly
Agent 385.995750 387.762875 [silence]
Agent 387.762875 389.240125 um-hum
Customer 388.742750 391.705500 but they can be very dangerous if you don't

Agent 390.723625 393.988250 oh they sure can that's for sure
Customer 391.705500 393.488625 [silence]
Customer 393.488625 396.488625 especially yeah that interest is terrible
Agent 393.988250 395.485750 [silence]
Agent 395.485750 396.804625 i know
Customer 396.488625 400.473625 [silence]

Agent 405.726500 408.797250 [vocalized-noise] automatic approval
Agent 408.797250 412.765875 and they get them and then these kids start charging and
Agent 412.765875 421.745000 and they get themselves into some deep trouble before they [laughter-even] start making money they're already in debt [laughter-you] [laughter-know] let alone loans and stuff

Customer 432.986875 441.276750 [silence]
Agent 437.147000 448.211125 it's yeah it's just uh something that's automatically taken out of our paychecks each week and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here about seven weeks ago and
Customer 441.276750 442.990875 uh-huh

Customer 455.471750 457.961250 oh man
Agent 456.191000 468.274500 and it wasn't covered by insurance so that's something where y[ou]- you don't plan on it's not something that you can you know you're not saving for a trip or whatever it's boom here it is
Customer 457.961250 465.449375 [silence]
