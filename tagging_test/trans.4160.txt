Agent 129.742500 143.476750 [silence]
Customer 130.475625 144.214500 she says as long as she's dealing with the numbers and it's just adding them up and then subtracting from the the target totals she says it's just as quick to do that way as to to uh enter it on the computer and have it check the arithmetic
Agent 143.476750 154.995750 yeah i think i think generally people do find that that probably is just as quick to keep by hand the only question is whether whether the additional reports and the uh
