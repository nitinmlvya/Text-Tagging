Agent 152.467250 153.570375 yeah
Customer 153.535875 162.688125 and i don't know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed there's no doubt about it
Agent 153.570375 161.724500 [silence]
Agent 161.724500 166.691750 everybody's gone down i think the individual levels are fine

Agent 166.691750 169.785125 uh i don't think they're perceived as uh
Customer 166.738750 177.476625 [silence]
Agent 169.785125 177.889375 was i learned in school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a hundred thousand dollars you know
Customer 177.476625 178.799625 uh-huh
Agent 177.889375 181.515000 uh we wouldn't reduce the deficit [laughter-by]

Customer 180.629500 181.909750 yeah
Agent 181.515000 185.058500 but but a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that
Customer 181.909750 184.117625 [silence]
Customer 184.117625 185.432875 yeah
Agent 185.058500 192.104375 [silence]
Customer 185.432875 193.161875 well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean we've talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or
Agent 192.104375 195.135000 well that's what sales tax are
Customer 193.161875 194.228625 [silence]
Customer 194.228625 202.578500 yeah that's true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but
Agent 195.135000 207.028500 [silence]
Customer 202.578500 207.936500 maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that
Agent 207.028500 218.780875 that uh flat taxes i think are a pretty good idea uh they're debating of course right now whether to bring in capital gains again uh to stimulate the economy
Customer 207.936500 210.748375 [silence]
Customer 210.748375 211.990250 uh-huh
Customer 211.990250 215.444375 [silence]

Customer 216.451500 227.450625 [silence]
Agent 218.780875 230.532625 and uh find from what i from what i recall it doesn't stimulate the economy that much it just uh [laughter-boots] everybody's feeling about stimulating the economy
Customer 227.450625 231.401125 yeah that's more or less touchy-feely thing as opposed to
Agent 230.532625 232.110375 yeah
Customer 231.401125 235.735125 yeah i just always heard that the poor would e[nd]- end up taking the worst brunt of it because they're
Agent 232.110375 251.624250 [silence]
Customer 235.735125 248.777125 you know their their income is less and yet they're being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know i've heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that it'll be maybe a different level of tax but
Customer 248.777125 254.378875 seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldn't do much anyway
Agent 251.624250 252.786875 the
Agent 252.786875 253.980500 [silence]
Agent 253.980500 262.096125 i- i what happens is i think it is a good idea but they chip away at it i mean the home mortgage deduction is like sacrosanct
Customer 254.378875 259.109250 [silence]
Customer 259.109250 260.454125 um-hum

Customer 262.942625 264.019625 [silence]
Customer 264.019625 265.356500 [noise]
Customer 265.356500 267.483500 yeah that's true

Customer 273.789125 275.001125 uh-huh
Agent 274.500250 278.146000 i- i think it is in theory probably a good idea
Customer 275.001125 277.434000 [silence]
Customer 277.434000 278.866500 well uh
Agent 278.146000 282.064375 [silence]

Customer 289.628000 293.978375 [silence]
Agent 292.698625 294.959125 that's a regressive tax
