Agent 21.927750 29.103875 i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was going but then as i started making more money um
Agent 29.103875 35.397500 my budget's kind of hasn't doesn't exist except for at certain times [laughter] you know
Customer 34.487250 37.251000 right and you make more money but it goes away anyway
Agent 35.397500 36.926000 [silence]
Agent 36.926000 49.079375 right well i don't have to worry i mean i don't have to think ahead as much like you know but i haven't really saved anything i'm still trying to uh i've i have school debts i'm still paying back and stuff
Customer 37.251000 47.971375 [silence]
Customer 47.971375 57.161125 yeah i have three children and a house so uh it's a s[erious]- it's a serious matter but uh my wife's just starting to go back to work maybe that'll take the
Agent 49.079375 50.997000 [silence]
Agent 50.997000 53.525500 oh okay so you have to budget
Agent 53.525500 65.695250 [silence]
Customer 57.161125 66.213000 pressure off but i must [noise] i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like
Agent 65.695250 66.934875 right
Customer 66.213000 76.351000 tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i do[n't]- i've started keeping a budget on computer
Agent 66.934875 71.155500 [silence]
Agent 71.155500 72.506250 right
Agent 72.506250 79.632875 [silence]
Customer 76.351000 87.012750 i guess each of the last five years and never followed through and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping would've helped and uh
Agent 79.632875 81.376625 [laughter]
Agent 81.376625 86.474125 [silence]
Agent 86.474125 87.849375 um-hum
Customer 87.012750 91.223000 i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should
Agent 87.849375 91.196750 [silence]
Agent 91.196750 102.620500 yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's going
Customer 91.223000 101.940500 [silence]
Customer 101.940500 103.192625 right
Agent 102.620500 111.305125 then you it's it's easier even if you don't stick to it i think it you know it's better to have you a little bit more conservative hm
Customer 103.192625 110.252375 [silence]
Customer 110.252375 115.122250 right i believe if i had to that i could [noise] estimate
Agent 111.305125 132.798625 [silence]
Customer 115.122250 125.625000 all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but i'm sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh
Customer 125.625000 133.384000 i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan
Agent 132.798625 134.307875 yeah
Customer 133.384000 135.699875 [noise] but
Agent 134.307875 146.498250 but even i[f]- you can't i don't think have enou[gh]- a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly [laughter-where] every penny was going before i had it but
Customer 135.699875 150.119000 [silence]
Agent 146.498250 150.565500 it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway
Customer 150.119000 151.329125 yeah
Agent 150.565500 161.470750 but also it i think it's bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know you're paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes
Customer 151.329125 169.552500 [silence]
Agent 161.470750 171.341750 i've looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and
Customer 169.552500 181.855375 yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have children [noise] what you're gonna need for them a few years from now is what you need to be putting aside now and that's uh you can fool yourself if you don't set that up somehow
Agent 171.341750 177.265750 [silence]
Agent 177.265750 178.646750 right
Agent 178.646750 181.266625 [silence]
Agent 181.266625 190.137375 and that's hard to see but if you if you try to be too strict on yourself then your then you just end up getting really frustrated don't ever you know just
Customer 181.855375 187.322625 [silence]
Customer 187.322625 188.557875 right
Customer 188.557875 191.279375 [silence]
Agent 190.137375 192.964000 just blow a little bit that's you know
Customer 191.279375 192.476500 right
Customer 192.476500 202.124875 but you'll find that the [noise] kids don't really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly [laughter]
Agent 192.964000 200.136500 [silence]
Agent 200.136500 204.321500 right i remember doing that as a child [laughter]
Customer 202.124875 216.601250 and i've i learned to say no pretty much constantly [laughter] and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month i'd feel better about it [noise]
Agent 204.321500 206.452750 [noise] yeah
Agent 206.452750 215.316500 [silence]
Agent 215.316500 216.679500 yeah

Customer 246.635125 248.649375 [laughter]

Customer 248.649375 253.395250 [silence]
