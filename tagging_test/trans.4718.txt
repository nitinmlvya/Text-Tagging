Customer 206.283875 208.242500 that's uh
Customer 208.242500 209.248875 [silence]
Customer 209.248875 212.170250 not not uh
Customer 212.170250 215.371625 with not too many choices
Agent 213.736000 223.466750 yeah i guess a lot of the more uh some of the newer companies and the up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way but some people say it ends up costing them_1 more because whatever
Customer 215.371625 232.146625 [silence]
Agent 223.466750 229.757125 you know men and women alike they give them_1 say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health insurance and their retirement and whatever but
Agent 229.757125 232.582250 and if th[ey]- whatever they don't use they get in cash
Customer 232.146625 233.559250 yeah
Agent 232.582250 240.218625 but a lot of companies don't like to do that because they figure if you got two people working then one spouse might take insurance and the other won't so it saves the company money
Customer 233.559250 239.846375 [silence]
Customer 239.846375 240.988000 yeah
