Customer 36.712250 41.234250 [silence]
Customer 41.234250 50.525625 well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and

Customer 50.525625 51.742375 [silence]
Customer 51.742375 60.963750 absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest

Customer 131.716250 135.732625 [silence]
Customer 135.732625 146.604250 oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash
Agent 137.684625 139.211500 yeah
Agent 139.211500 145.996250 [silence]
Agent 145.996250 147.684375 uh-huh
Customer 146.604250 153.239125 and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
Agent 147.684375 152.484250 [silence]
Agent 152.484250 155.985875 you're right and that's kind of silly
Customer 153.239125 154.357250 [silence]
Customer 154.357250 161.741125 yeah right absolutely because they figure that [noise] that's correct [laughter] the idea is to use their [laughter-money]
Agent 155.985875 159.279750 yeah your defeating the purpose
Agent 159.279750 160.499375 [silence]

Agent 161.497500 162.814625 yeah
Customer 161.741125 162.984625 [laughter]
Agent 162.814625 164.733125 [silence]

Agent 166.473750 177.989875 yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it because i
Customer 167.489875 170.252500 [silence]
Customer 170.252500 171.826750 um-hum
Customer 171.826750 175.328250 [silence]
Customer 175.328250 181.984125 right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted
Agent 177.989875 179.776375 yeah
Agent 179.776375 181.757125 yeah it's like
Agent 181.757125 191.287125 i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know you've already been preapproved
Customer 181.984125 187.829250 [silence]
Customer 187.829250 189.808250 well i[t]-
Customer 189.808250 194.486250 and oh absolutely preapproved that's their favorite word
Agent 191.287125 192.779875 [silence]
Agent 192.779875 196.250875 yes everybody in the country is preapproved i think
Customer 194.486250 206.994625 [laughter] i think so you're right well it's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go
Agent 196.250875 197.244750 [laughter]
Agent 197.244750 198.302375 [silence]

Agent 203.540000 211.971625 uh-huh yeah and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find

Agent 211.971625 220.268875 wow i didn't realize i had this much you know i'd spent this much money and then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it
Customer 214.768250 217.201125 that much spent right
Customer 217.201125 219.365875 [silence]
Customer 219.365875 229.466750 well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
Agent 220.268875 223.988500 [silence]
Agent 223.988500 225.499000 uh-huh
Agent 225.499000 228.269625 [silence]
Agent 228.269625 241.946250 yeah it does because you're you know [vocalized-noise] you're you know you're just co[sting]- costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the monthly the minimum payment you're paying interest again so yeah
Customer 229.466750 238.729500 [silence]
Customer 238.729500 244.982250 that's right that's right well it's been enjoyable talking with you
