Customer 51.350250 56.475500 well um i uh right now i'm into a weird situation i'm a graduate student and uh
Agent 52.380875 55.937500 [silence]
Agent 55.937500 57.488125 oh okay
Customer 56.475500 59.356125 uh i don't have that many benefits per se [laughter]
Agent 57.488125 58.870500 [silence]
Agent 58.870500 60.353500 [laughter-yes]
Customer 59.356125 60.590000 um
Agent 60.353500 65.072625 okay but but on the other hand [vocalized-noise] one of these days you'll be out looking for a
Customer 60.590000 62.021875 sort of get
Customer 62.021875 64.069750 [silence]
Customer 64.069750 68.814875 yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um
Agent 65.072625 71.725625 [silence]
Customer 68.814875 71.865500 uh i think health insurance is real real important
Agent 71.725625 72.881000 yeah
Customer 71.865500 77.232875 uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um
Agent 72.881000 87.384500 [silence]
Customer 77.232875 87.907750 a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance
Agent 87.384500 88.920125 yeah
Customer 87.907750 98.514125 they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical [vocalized-noise] they they force you to buy here now i'm covered by my wife's anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester
Agent 88.920125 95.136625 [silence]
Agent 95.136625 97.076500 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 97.076500 100.109000 right okay
Customer 98.514125 105.728000 for uh mandatory so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case i'd rather that that went to something else
Agent 100.109000 104.959875 [silence]
Agent 104.959875 111.708500 and and yeah and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's
Customer 105.728000 110.724625 [silence]
Customer 110.724625 118.508125 right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars
Agent 111.708500 139.981875 [silence]
Customer 118.508125 130.729375 sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're v[ery]- they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians
Customer 130.729375 143.648875 so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um
Agent 139.981875 141.830875 yeah
Agent 141.830875 152.457875 [silence]
Customer 143.648875 154.366750 but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job i don't you know
Agent 152.457875 160.084750 uh yeah i it uh
Customer 154.366750 203.427500 [silence]
Agent 160.084750 174.887250 the th[at]- that i[s]- that's a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there it's uh if i remember right you well if they
Agent 174.887250 187.050375 they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh
Agent 187.050375 198.393375 two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i i'm coming up on i've been at TI now uh uh
Agent 198.393375 211.358625 coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah that's a that that is a a a negative but uh
Customer 203.427500 208.167625 oh wow [noise] so that's the real [noise]
Customer 208.167625 215.100875 [silence]
Agent 211.358625 216.325625 but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh
Customer 215.100875 224.905625 yeah i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off they [vocalized-noise] you know usually let her
Agent 216.325625 221.480000 [silence]
Agent 221.480000 222.400250 yeah
Agent 222.400250 223.813375 [silence]
Agent 223.813375 234.483000 well that that yeah that's uh th[at]- that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh
Customer 224.905625 230.709125 [silence]
Customer 230.709125 232.257125 yeah
Customer 232.257125 247.309875 [silence]
Agent 234.483000 248.001375 that's the the the uh yeah th[at]- that's uh why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour
Customer 247.309875 248.977750 oh really
Agent 248.001375 260.753625 and uh and but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing
Customer 248.977750 258.629500 [silence]
Customer 258.629500 259.936625 no
Customer 259.936625 261.446000 yeah
Agent 260.753625 268.106750 uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh
Customer 261.446000 273.829750 [silence]
Agent 268.106750 275.460000 the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different but uh
Customer 273.829750 275.577125 that's oh that's a
Agent 275.460000 287.203500 but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh the they've uh uh
Customer 275.577125 277.428750 that's reasonable i think
Customer 277.428750 309.375125 [silence]
Agent 287.203500 290.872250 gone through a couple years ago here where they
Agent 290.872250 303.235375 uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now they're in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that
Agent 303.235375 307.349000 just routine visits uh ah they will
Agent 307.349000 320.845250 compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah
Customer 309.375125 311.141375 yeah
Customer 311.141375 317.830625 [silence]
Customer 317.830625 319.779125 weigh are see such of things
Customer 319.779125 333.285000 yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance
Agent 320.845250 340.288750 [silence]
Customer 333.285000 341.986500 and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so
Agent 340.288750 348.075000 well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh
Customer 341.986500 363.483625 [silence]
Agent 348.075000 361.550875 to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to uh uh give you
Agent 361.550875 374.823500 you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're you're not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh i'm not i'm not sure it my uh
Customer 363.483625 364.931125 um-hum
Customer 364.931125 370.027125 [silence]
Customer 370.027125 371.261125 right
Customer 371.261125 395.986250 [silence]
Agent 374.823500 386.242625 one of the phrases i use is that that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of
Agent 386.242625 397.837500 always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides here it's it's uh
Customer 395.986250 399.066375 at least us who decides
Agent 397.837500 410.908500 yeah uh and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh
Customer 399.066375 422.427250 [silence]
Agent 410.908500 425.163125 idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i
Customer 422.427250 424.415375 right
Customer 424.415375 442.240000 [silence]
Agent 425.163125 432.738000 i don't know in in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh
Agent 432.738000 444.039000 although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
Customer 442.240000 449.822000 right you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that that's the
Agent 444.039000 445.943625 [silence]
Agent 445.943625 447.283125 yeah
Agent 447.283125 449.822000 yeah and
