Agent 34.380000 49.169000 [silence]
Customer 38.399250 40.725125 having it uh as a
Customer 40.725125 42.390250 you know business
Customer 42.390250 44.342625 uh to
Customer 44.342625 49.472500 uh you know to so the you know the government doesn't have to deal with it
Agent 49.169000 51.020625 i hadn't heard that
Customer 49.472500 50.808375 [silence]
Customer 50.808375 57.635125 but uh yeah because i think it's all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obvious[ly]- so
Agent 51.020625 55.266875 [silence]
Agent 55.266875 56.460750 right
Agent 56.460750 58.561875 [silence]
Customer 57.635125 59.093750 but um

Customer 59.093750 60.509750 but see they're
Agent 60.241625 80.870000 [silence]
Customer 60.509750 63.443875 they don't have enough um
Customer 63.443875 65.073250 [silence]
Customer 65.073250 66.653750 um
Customer 66.653750 74.494375 you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to
Customer 74.494375 78.799125 maybe have uh you know private you know business
Customer 78.799125 81.592000 private enterprise come in so
Agent 80.870000 87.634125 well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make
Customer 81.592000 98.188500 [silence]
Agent 87.634125 98.762125 license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work
Customer 98.188500 99.346875 um-hum
Agent 98.762125 108.540250 rather than sitting there it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the United States i feel the same way
Customer 99.346875 116.461500 [silence]
Agent 108.540250 116.340250 uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there
Agent 116.340250 117.598750 [silence]
Customer 116.461500 117.720625 um-hum
Agent 117.598750 121.304125 so it's self defen[se]- you know self-defense on that point
Customer 117.720625 133.447750 [silence]
Agent 121.304125 122.930750 um
Agent 122.930750 125.805375 as far as my defense
Agent 125.805375 127.366375 budget
Agent 127.366375 134.273375 uh they're cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that
Customer 133.447750 134.563375 yeah
Agent 134.273375 135.845250 [silence]
Customer 134.563375 159.186750 [silence]
Agent 135.845250 143.228250 but again i'd like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today
Agent 143.228250 146.201750 so i'm lost on that one
Agent 146.201750 147.480000 [silence]
Agent 147.480000 149.756750 i would like to be a little more
Agent 149.756750 156.022375 into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems
Agent 156.022375 159.219375 and to come up with something a little better than what we've got
Customer 159.186750 160.375125 um-hum
Agent 159.219375 180.424375 [silence]
Customer 160.375125 164.170750 yeah its tough to to say what um
Customer 164.170750 165.264875 [silence]
Customer 165.264875 172.326125 you know what uh as far as this [noise] that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and
Customer 172.326125 177.398500 all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that
Customer 177.398500 178.585875 [silence]
Customer 178.585875 180.638750 they so uh
Agent 180.424375 185.662250 well not so much pay i'm not trying to see the government put out any more
Customer 180.638750 185.492000 [silence]
Customer 185.492000 196.927250 no yeah i know what you are saying but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here
Agent 185.662250 199.970625 [silence]
Customer 196.927250 199.540625 it you know it's just up to high school
Customer 199.540625 218.524625 [silence]
Agent 199.970625 207.685500 yeah but see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college
Agent 207.685500 209.151000 [silence]
Agent 209.151000 218.469125 to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up
Agent 218.469125 220.992500 you know why not an apprentice out to a
Customer 218.524625 219.649000 hum-um
Customer 219.649000 229.880375 [silence]
Agent 220.992500 226.790875 a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or
Agent 226.790875 228.639500 you know just a technician
Agent 228.639500 230.749500 you can learn on the job
Customer 229.880375 231.079625 um-hum
Agent 230.749500 239.754125 which of course again which m[ean]- would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight
Customer 231.079625 239.083500 [silence]
Customer 239.083500 240.143875 yeah
Agent 239.754125 241.710625 but that would come down
Customer 240.143875 241.685125 [silence]
Customer 241.685125 244.816750 i think the pro[gram]- you know that's one reason uh
Agent 241.710625 285.780875 [silence]
Customer 244.816750 250.934500 you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh
Customer 250.934500 253.999125 they're not willing to you know to put that you know
Customer 253.999125 257.908125 the training for only a certain amount so
Customer 257.908125 260.663500 um it's you know
Customer 260.663500 263.178625 as far as the technical side
Customer 263.178625 264.228625 [silence]
Customer 264.228625 265.533500 but uh
Customer 265.533500 269.048500 even like one one of the biggest things now is like
Customer 269.048500 276.438750 paralegals and stuff i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field but they can't just bring somebody in
Customer 276.438750 283.614750 without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work
Customer 283.614750 286.480125 you know for a lawyer as a paralegal
Agent 285.780875 294.400750 excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her
Customer 286.480125 293.980625 [silence]
Customer 293.980625 307.885375 um-hum well yeah i i'm well ye[ah]- i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in
Agent 294.400750 336.604625 [silence]
Customer 307.885375 311.447625 you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off
Customer 311.447625 318.288500 bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously there's uh uh you know there's a lot to learn
Customer 318.288500 320.606000 uh after that but
Customer 320.606000 325.108250 but uh that's true i'm i'm sure there's a lot of um
Customer 325.108250 334.197250 you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel i've got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up
Customer 334.197250 335.910750 [noise]
Customer 335.910750 337.292500 is that better
Agent 336.604625 340.383625 yes [laughter] wow [laughter]
Customer 337.292500 338.551500 okay
Customer 338.551500 340.126875 an[d]-
Customer 340.126875 348.462750 yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that
Agent 340.383625 347.572500 [silence]
Agent 347.572500 351.085000 yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world [laughter-somewhere]
Customer 348.462750 350.809625 [silence]
Customer 350.809625 353.206750 anyway so um
Agent 351.085000 354.321000 [silence]
Customer 353.206750 354.263625 [silence]
Customer 354.263625 356.619500 but uh you know i think uh
Agent 354.321000 355.731375 we[ll]-
Agent 355.731375 370.894375 [silence]
Customer 356.619500 371.504375 they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people
Agent 370.894375 372.133375 um-hum
Customer 371.504375 376.864625 you know stuff like that programs like that you know i don't know you know what kind of options they've got
Agent 372.133375 376.631875 [silence]
Agent 376.631875 381.429875 well that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now
Customer 376.864625 398.793375 [silence]
Agent 381.429875 389.382375 and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields
Agent 389.382375 399.730625 but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level
Customer 398.793375 400.143250 uh-huh
Agent 399.730625 406.777875 which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school they're they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around
Customer 400.143250 406.620125 [silence]
Customer 406.620125 407.680000 um-hum
Agent 406.777875 418.015875 because they don't have any education i don't mean college and i'm for college but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned they've had it
Customer 407.680000 417.862000 [silence]
Customer 417.862000 421.153000 yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only
Agent 418.015875 431.386250 [silence]
Customer 421.153000 422.173500 [silence]
Customer 422.173500 424.837000 it was either sixty percent or forty percent
Customer 424.837000 426.612625 go to college
Customer 426.612625 429.906875 and then out of that percentage only so many
Customer 429.906875 431.747375 can get their degree
Agent 431.386250 432.473250 um-hum
Customer 431.747375 433.039500 [silence]
Agent 432.473250 442.308375 [silence]
Customer 433.039500 435.049625 so i thought that was interesting
Customer 435.049625 436.148750 [silence]
Customer 436.148750 441.278125 but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so
Customer 441.278125 445.889000 [silence]
Agent 442.308375 443.347500 oh yeah but
Agent 443.347500 444.526625 [silence]
Agent 444.526625 446.480000 there's a lot of them out there that haven't
Customer 445.889000 452.101750 yeah well i ju[st]- you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and
Agent 446.480000 448.649875 so that's
Agent 448.649875 461.699375 [silence]
Customer 452.101750 458.590250 yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on
Customer 458.590250 461.765750 and they go to college etcetera
Agent 461.699375 472.241125 well it seems to me that kids that a[re]- get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it
Customer 461.765750 492.096125 [silence]
Agent 472.241125 480.766375 usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like
Agent 480.766375 492.960250 because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lo[t]- happier life for themselves
Customer 492.096125 493.302125 yeah
Agent 492.960250 500.663625 question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do
Customer 493.302125 501.069875 [silence]
Agent 500.663625 580.570000 [silence]
Customer 501.069875 506.442625 well as [noise] as far as the you know the deficit that's a whole nother
Customer 506.442625 519.535000 uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries
Customer 519.535000 529.109375 and that we have more money or goo[ds]- you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know [noise] and um
Customer 529.109375 538.560625 you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country
Customer 538.560625 545.050375 and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here
Customer 545.050375 556.969500 and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours
Customer 556.969500 558.817000 but um
Customer 558.817000 561.371625 it's just that uh
Customer 561.371625 562.958000 they're in
Customer 562.958000 570.604375 [noise] i think you're you're going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh
Customer 570.604375 577.479875 uh the mon[ey]- you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh
Customer 577.479875 581.052500 sell products abroad as much as we bring in so
Agent 580.570000 589.809250 were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the
Customer 581.052500 597.035625 [silence]
Agent 589.809250 598.612375 the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting
Customer 597.035625 598.113625 hum-um
Customer 598.113625 599.997500 [silence]
Agent 598.612375 599.997500 [silence]
