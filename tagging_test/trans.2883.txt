Agent 13.850625 15.266875 [silence]
Agent 15.266875 17.492500 right
Customer 16.345000 24.405500 uh interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think don't you
Agent 17.492500 23.617625 [silence]
Agent 23.617625 24.885750 [laughter-yeah]
Customer 24.405500 30.564750 otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly
Agent 24.885750 30.100000 [silence]
Agent 30.100000 31.652000 that's right
Customer 30.564750 33.347875 uh it's not a very good idea
Agent 31.652000 33.396375 [silence]
Customer 33.347875 34.593625 [silence]
Agent 33.396375 35.257250 do you have a lot of credit cards
Customer 34.593625 37.701500 well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though
Agent 35.257250 37.055000 [silence]
Agent 37.055000 38.398125 right
Customer 37.701500 38.597875 [laughter]
Agent 38.398125 62.445125 [silence]
Customer 38.597875 43.187750 i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh
Customer 43.187750 45.061500 tuition if it's
Customer 45.061500 52.047500 you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can
Customer 52.047500 57.336750 the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off
Customer 57.336750 63.433750 uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
Agent 62.445125 64.277125 oh yeah
Customer 63.433750 65.531250 just goes on and on
Agent 64.277125 66.617250 which is what they want
Customer 65.531250 66.767750 yeah
Agent 66.617250 75.778875 i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in a month so
Customer 66.767750 74.874750 [silence]
Customer 74.874750 76.536750 yeah that's true
Agent 75.778875 79.189000 they uh make the mistake of pushing all their cards
Customer 76.536750 77.379125 [silence]
Customer 77.379125 81.985000 there are times when it's when it's very useful like uh emergency trip
Agent 79.189000 80.219000 [silence]
Agent 80.219000 84.034625 yeah yeah
Customer 81.985000 85.339750 or something sometimes when you when you
Agent 84.034625 96.169125 [silence]
Customer 85.339750 88.088250 the the money will be available but it's
Customer 88.088250 98.027750 you know not immediately handy i think uh they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
Agent 96.169125 98.472250 right
Customer 98.027750 103.273250 but uh i you really do need to be very um
Agent 98.472250 107.976750 [silence]
Customer 103.273250 104.369250 [silence]
Customer 104.369250 108.811250 oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble
Agent 107.976750 112.304375 [noise] yeah i made that mistake when i first got a job and that's kind of like
Customer 108.811250 114.570375 [silence]
Agent 112.304375 115.030500 it took me quite a while to pay them off
Customer 114.570375 116.057875 uh-huh
Agent 115.030500 116.294375 so
Customer 116.057875 128.687875 [silence]
Agent 116.294375 119.424000 af[ter]- after that i decided well i'm not going to use them_1 at all
Agent 119.424000 123.650000 and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then
Agent 123.650000 127.293250 we got married so we decided to you know if we used them we would
Agent 127.293250 129.990125 pay them off as we go so
Customer 128.687875 129.899625 right
Customer 129.899625 133.704500 right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances
Agent 129.990125 144.833750 [silence]
Customer 133.704500 142.888625 the other thing about them is too if you really don't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven't developed a credit thing
Customer 142.888625 154.097250 it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or
Agent 144.833750 146.484000 right
Agent 146.484000 152.813250 [silence]

Agent 155.143000 161.548250 [silence]
Agent 161.548250 163.316250 uh-huh
Agent 163.316250 173.052750 [silence]
Customer 163.773875 167.490125 but uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up
Customer 167.490125 174.238375 uh going in the deep end and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble
Agent 173.052750 175.153750 um-hum
Customer 174.238375 179.484375 we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh

Agent 190.765000 192.506625 oh

Agent 195.438500 208.063000 [silence]
Customer 196.223125 202.593750 it's a really big problem i think and um takes mature people to
Customer 202.593750 208.971500 to treat it uh so that it's so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
Agent 208.063000 216.318625 right i think um the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year
Customer 208.971500 215.849375 [silence]
Customer 215.849375 217.104750 yeah
