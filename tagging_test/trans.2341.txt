Agent 0.000000 12.926250 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 4.689750 the taxes tend to uh keep going up but
Customer 4.689750 12.884375 uh i don't know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well there's always someone that's [noise] that's worse off in what they end up paying
Customer 12.884375 15.194500 but uh go ahead
Agent 12.926250 18.980000 i think i think we're always convinced that we're paying too much in taxes
Customer 15.194500 29.527875 [silence]
Agent 18.980000 24.769000 without getting back necessarily everything we'd like to but so far
Agent 24.769000 29.494625 i don't think i've paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet
Agent 29.494625 48.359250 [silence]
Customer 29.527875 32.819250 yeah i'm still still i'm able to survive and
Customer 32.819250 44.145125 and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money it's almost like you're paying your own salary i don't work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and
Customer 44.145125 50.258375 being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days it's still uh
Agent 48.359250 49.676750 yes
Agent 49.676750 56.003250 [silence]
Customer 50.258375 56.435500 still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way
Agent 56.003250 57.192375 right
Customer 56.435500 63.471875 uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh
Agent 57.192375 87.010125 [silence]
Customer 63.471875 72.113750 a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and
Customer 72.113750 81.801375 and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area it's still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government
Customer 81.801375 82.820250 [silence]
Customer 82.820250 86.995125 so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes
Customer 86.995125 88.013750 people
Agent 87.010125 88.092000 right
Customer 88.013750 91.034250 desire that that money not be spent well
Agent 88.092000 90.960000 [silence]
Agent 90.960000 93.290250 do you all pay state income tax
Customer 91.034250 93.171250 [silence]
Customer 93.171250 97.587375 no no Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet that's
Agent 93.290250 96.618500 [silence]
Agent 96.618500 103.835625 neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part they've just started talking about introducing a state income tax
Customer 97.587375 111.020250 [silence]
Agent 103.835625 110.867500 and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent
Agent 110.867500 119.256375 [silence]
Customer 111.020250 119.741875 well by the time the city gets involved i'm not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent
Agent 119.256375 120.451000 wow
Customer 119.741875 128.441375 so it's it's pretty pretty much but i think it's divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some
Agent 120.451000 127.988000 [silence]
Agent 127.988000 129.070125 right
Customer 128.441375 129.498750 [silence]
Agent 129.070125 145.018375 [silence]
Customer 129.498750 136.553625 and it's it's quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere
Customer 136.553625 145.748125 but we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes
Agent 145.018375 146.226750 well that's good
Customer 145.748125 154.698875 yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of
Agent 146.226750 165.728500 [silence]
Customer 154.698875 162.833625 lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so it's
Customer 162.833625 165.863250 it's a real mixed blessing i guess to
Agent 165.728500 174.153500 that's i think that's the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots
Customer 165.863250 184.474125 [silence]
Agent 174.153500 184.393250 and i- i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again
Agent 184.393250 195.876000 [silence]
Customer 184.474125 187.413500 yeah it'd be nice if you could find someone
Customer 187.413500 189.143000 oh
Customer 189.143000 196.666125 uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then you'd have to find a way to make it work [laughter]
Agent 195.876000 203.050000 i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R [laughter]
Customer 196.666125 201.227625 [silence]
Customer 201.227625 203.095625 yeah yeah
Agent 203.050000 221.566750 [silence]
Customer 203.095625 207.410250 the uh bureaucracy seems to spend
Customer 207.410250 214.331625 more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh
Customer 214.331625 221.588000 an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases
Agent 221.566750 229.965250 i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic can't see the forest for the trees i- i wonder if if they realize
Customer 221.588000 223.014875 so it make
Customer 223.014875 235.550375 [silence]
Agent 229.965250 235.038000 the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through
Agent 235.038000 268.218875 [silence]
Customer 235.550375 236.795125 yeah
Customer 236.795125 241.285750 and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on
Customer 241.285750 252.625750 to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and we'll have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever
Customer 252.625750 255.787875 and they just keep trying to to
Customer 255.787875 263.048375 close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all they're doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and
Customer 263.048375 268.451750 and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse
Agent 268.218875 276.067250 and i don't i don't think they're getting their money's worth and i- i- i definitely don't think that the added
Customer 268.451750 287.636250 [silence]
Agent 276.067250 277.246500 [silence]
Agent 277.246500 286.111750 steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think it's just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws
Agent 286.111750 287.859625 they will find a way
Customer 287.636250 288.655125 um-hum
Agent 287.859625 293.762375 if they want to badly enough they'll either find it themselves or they'll find someone to do it for them
Customer 288.655125 293.408625 [silence]
Customer 293.408625 294.865375 right
Agent 293.762375 353.927500 [silence]
Customer 294.865375 297.144500 it does seem to be the case
Customer 297.144500 302.501750 i don't know whether it's worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a
Customer 302.501750 310.337125 hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every
Customer 310.337125 313.573625 dollar you make or spend it gets uh
Customer 313.573625 322.872250 steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then
Customer 322.872250 331.717750 just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everything's going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction
Customer 331.717750 334.892875 i don't know what what would happen if we
Customer 334.892875 344.248125 uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much
Customer 344.248125 350.451000 uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving it's not a
Customer 350.451000 354.968500 you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff
Agent 353.927500 355.297000 right
Customer 354.968500 356.982875 but if you put the burden on
Agent 355.297000 369.477875 [silence]
Customer 356.982875 364.042375 the retailer who really doesn't care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesn't care who bought the groceries you're going to pay the tax on it
Customer 364.042375 370.118625 so [vocalized-noise] most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our in[come]- income brackets
Agent 369.477875 371.086625 right [laughter]
Customer 370.118625 374.716375 so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would
Agent 371.086625 380.331750 [silence]
Customer 374.716375 380.351625 pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didn't save they wouldn't have to get or what they cou[ld]- could save they wouldn't get taxed on
Agent 380.331750 388.507250 and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it
Customer 380.351625 387.975250 [silence]
Customer 387.975250 391.247375 yeah but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward
Agent 388.507250 402.013875 [silence]
Customer 391.247375 396.624625 a particular type of savings you wouldn't be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know
Customer 396.624625 402.308375 avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRA's and all that they
Agent 402.013875 402.978250 yeah
Customer 402.308375 407.368375 you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money
Agent 402.978250 412.643125 [silence]
Customer 407.368375 410.992625 and it didn't have the taxation problem well you might
Customer 410.992625 413.691000 might do all right i don't know it seems
Agent 412.643125 418.440875 yeah even if you didn't invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest
Customer 413.691000 418.550000 [silence]
Agent 418.440875 420.949625 yo[u]- you'd still be ahead
Customer 418.550000 419.597750 yeah
Customer 419.597750 420.622250 [silence]
Customer 420.622250 422.069250 that's for sure
Agent 420.949625 422.248750 [silence]
Customer 422.069250 442.032875 [silence]
Agent 422.248750 427.814625 and that's something that's something i need t[o]- to learn a lot more about is is
Agent 427.814625 432.810125 under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future
Agent 432.810125 438.273625 because that's a that's a scary thought you always hear that Social Security won't be around by the time
Agent 438.273625 443.926375 we're sixty three or sixty five and and need it and that's a scary thought
Customer 442.032875 443.035250 right
Customer 443.035250 444.039875 [silence]
Agent 443.926375 448.924000 [silence]
Customer 444.039875 450.109500 that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway [laughter-so]
Agent 448.924000 449.964125 no
Agent 449.964125 470.825875 [silence]
Customer 450.109500 455.018750 you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away
Customer 455.018750 457.045500 yeah the uh
Customer 457.045500 459.628375 the taxes are are
Customer 459.628375 468.315625 kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things we've written into it but uh loo[king]- looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there
Customer 468.315625 471.014875 it's not all that pleasant anywhere
Agent 470.825875 472.589125 we still look pretty good don't we
Customer 471.014875 472.490125 [noise]
Customer 472.490125 474.335375 yeah pretty much
Agent 472.589125 477.179625 [silence]
Customer 474.335375 480.703500 well i hear one of my {kiddos} doing something they shouldn't be so i'll uh let you go and may[be]-
Agent 477.179625 478.536000 [laughter-okay]
Agent 478.536000 479.557500 [silence]
Agent 479.557500 481.287375 it's been nice talking to you
Customer 480.703500 482.680625 m[aybe]- maybe we'll catch each other again
Agent 481.287375 482.570875 [silence]
Agent 482.570875 484.182500 okay have a good evening
Customer 482.680625 483.685875 [silence]

Agent 484.182500 485.430875 thanks bye-bye
Customer 485.131375 486.603625 [noise]
Agent 485.430875 486.603625 [noise]
