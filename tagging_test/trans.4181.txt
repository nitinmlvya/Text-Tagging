Customer 103.942875 114.805125 which is taxes where you [vocalized-noise] most people forget about them_1 because you've g[ot]- you know you can't always get your FICA back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent FICA i'm paying forty percent tax
Agent 104.784125 106.602750 right
Agent 106.602750 109.483000 [silence]
Agent 109.483000 110.465500 right
Agent 110.465500 113.903625 [silence]
Agent 113.903625 122.747250 yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste
Customer 114.805125 122.025875 [silence]
Customer 122.025875 127.408000 yeah well i- i mean i think there's some people there y[ou]- there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need
Agent 122.747250 126.892375 [silence]
Agent 126.892375 128.156625 right
Customer 127.408000 131.945500 you kn[ow]- you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program
Agent 128.156625 131.437500 [silence]
Agent 131.437500 132.859000 right
Customer 131.945500 134.254500 than you're gonna get out of private individuals but
Agent 132.859000 137.966625 [silence]
Customer 134.254500 142.330875 you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way or
Agent 137.966625 139.424250 [laughter-right]
Agent 139.424250 140.729250 [silence]
Agent 140.729250 143.471000 that's right got to keep those farmers happy
Customer 142.330875 149.154125 you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in
Agent 143.471000 146.896750 [silence]
Agent 146.896750 148.293000 uh-huh
Agent 148.293000 159.477250 [silence]
Customer 149.154125 160.408250 into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the HEW services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them_1
Agent 159.477250 171.974750 right there i[s]- there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that [laughter-bureaucracy] running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs
Customer 160.408250 168.576875 [silence]
Customer 168.576875 169.996250 you know like we we
Customer 169.996250 171.211875 um
Customer 171.211875 174.607375 yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals
Agent 171.974750 181.135875 [silence]
Customer 174.607375 181.993625 and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
Agent 181.135875 182.574875 right
Customer 181.993625 191.441875 [silence]
Agent 182.574875 193.295000 [laughter-and] a lot of it's feeding uh just i just i really especially in the election year i mean i'm really thinking a lot [laughter-about] this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole
Customer 191.441875 192.653125 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 192.653125 212.335875 [silence]
Agent 193.295000 207.915375 it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy of the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are gonna keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government and expenditures
Agent 207.915375 214.263125 uh be[yond]- beyond what any other President since World War Two has done and yet he supposedly
Customer 212.335875 215.538375 well be[tween]- between between him and Reagan yeah
Agent 214.263125 221.959375 [laughter-right] right yeah i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national debt
Customer 215.538375 217.512375 the great communicator
Customer 217.512375 224.089375 [silence]
Agent 221.959375 227.329250 are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are suppo[sedly]- supposedly fiscally conservative
Customer 224.089375 226.413625 oh oh yeah they think
Customer 226.413625 230.636500 oh yeah and then they go and say and that Con[gress]- Congress they're the fault for it
Agent 227.329250 230.072125 [silence]
Agent 230.072125 231.373875 [laughter-right]
Customer 230.636500 240.766625 but you know the other thing is it's tricky though because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire you lose Grotten Connecticut goes so you know it's like
Agent 231.373875 234.792750 [silence]
Agent 234.792750 236.057750 right
Agent 236.057750 237.432375 [silence]
Agent 237.432375 238.656125 um-hum
Agent 238.656125 248.586375 [silence]
Customer 240.766625 249.487625 you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if those if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes
Agent 248.586375 250.491750 that's right
Customer 249.487625 253.995625 so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
Agent 250.491750 253.512125 [silence]
Agent 253.512125 259.571500 yeah it's really that is the especially that defense [vocalized-noise] cuts in the defense is really a catch-22
Customer 253.995625 259.006750 [silence]
Customer 259.006750 260.113750 yes
Agent 259.571500 269.005750 double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's gonna lower our national expenditures but then you're gonna have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in
Customer 260.113750 266.988500 [silence]
Customer 266.988500 269.121875 who who aren't contributing right yeah
Agent 269.005750 270.961250 so that's that's really
Customer 269.121875 270.873500 [silence]
Customer 270.873500 272.621375 and uh in our
Agent 270.961250 276.916375 it's i'm glad i'm not the one who has to come up with these [laughter-policies]
Customer 272.621375 273.639000 [silence]
Customer 273.639000 274.457000 right
Customer 274.457000 275.101625 [noise]
Customer 275.101625 277.383250 but what's very funny is in our town meeting
Agent 276.916375 284.382625 [silence]
Customer 277.383250 290.198500 they were vo[ting]- th[is]- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution [noise] for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes
Agent 284.382625 285.604875 uh-huh
Agent 285.604875 289.547375 [silence]
Agent 289.547375 290.794000 right
Customer 290.198500 292.971125 they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this
Agent 290.794000 296.513875 [silence]
Customer 292.971125 297.198125 course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they don't use
Agent 296.513875 298.626000 that's right
Customer 297.198125 298.207000 [silence]
Customer 298.207000 298.626000 yeah
