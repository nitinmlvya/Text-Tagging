Customer 16.844125 23.411000 [silence]
Agent 19.299000 23.425250 well uh the really sad part of this is that i'm fifty five years old
Customer 23.411000 25.531000 that's not that [laughter-bad]
Agent 23.425250 24.507125 and
Agent 24.507125 26.384000 beg your pardon
Customer 25.531000 27.736250 that's not so sad
Agent 26.384000 30.372375 oh my chances of getting another job are just really slim
Customer 27.736250 29.960250 [silence]
Customer 29.960250 31.321875 hm
Agent 30.372375 33.633000 i was a systems analyst for an oil company
Customer 31.321875 32.968375 [silence]
Customer 32.968375 34.438375 right
Agent 33.633000 42.686500 and you know they just i mean Sprint had uh two thousand jobs open i mean i'm sorry two hundred jobs open they had two thousand applications
Customer 34.438375 43.827750 [silence]
Agent 42.686500 51.478875 for this type of work you know it's just uh and i guess that's that's pretty far-fetched as benefits go
Customer 43.827750 45.503750 uh-huh
Customer 45.503750 56.672000 [silence]
Agent 51.478875 57.891625 but gosh you know i saw it i was fixed for life [laughter] so uh
Customer 56.672000 64.457375 i think more and more people are finding that out even people with state and and uh federal jobs it it's a shock
Agent 57.891625 63.080875 [silence]
Agent 63.080875 65.762750 it really is it really is
Customer 64.457375 73.787875 [silence]
Agent 65.762750 74.244000 but uh i- i think uh i guess my feelings on this are that the one of the most important benefits we currently have is our health insurance
Customer 73.787875 75.529625 that's true
Agent 74.244000 78.763000 and that if there were some way to get that to follow you from job to job
Customer 75.529625 82.385625 [silence]
Agent 78.763000 82.914000 or so that you would not lose it if you have to leave a company
Customer 82.385625 87.968000 isn't there some sort of deal where you can continue your benefits for eighteen months
Agent 82.914000 86.859375 [silence]
Agent 86.859375 93.488750 there is uh-huh and and that's fine but you know i'm still unemployed after about fourteen months okay
Customer 87.968000 93.012500 [silence]
Customer 93.012500 95.581750 oh yeah that's worrisome
Agent 93.488750 99.206125 and when you switch yeah when you switch over the the premiums are really quite high
Customer 95.581750 101.438375 [silence]
Agent 99.206125 101.662875 and additionally i've had a heart attack
Customer 101.438375 103.658500 um
Agent 101.662875 112.852250 so it's going to be really tough for me to do this so you know uh in in my very personal way i feel that insurance is just one of the most important benefits we have now
Customer 103.658500 118.726375 [silence]
Agent 112.852250 117.697875 now with the poli[tical]- political situation the way it is i think that's going to change
Agent 117.697875 119.014250 [silence]
Customer 118.726375 121.765625 you talking about national health
Agent 119.014250 120.469625 because
Agent 120.469625 123.703375 i think we're going to have to have something of that sort
Customer 121.765625 123.591125 [silence]
Customer 123.591125 125.033875 um
Agent 123.703375 128.138125 so that will cease to be as important a benefit
Customer 125.033875 127.986875 [silence]
Customer 127.986875 134.490000 i think that well i think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high is because people are
Agent 128.138125 131.099125 what are your feelings what what do you feel
Agent 131.099125 137.883000 [silence]
Customer 134.490000 138.454875 suing left and right and just driving these costs up
Agent 137.883000 143.964500 well i agree with you but do you know that's that's what makes this such a tremendous benefit if you can possible get group rates
Customer 138.454875 143.572000 [silence]
Customer 143.572000 147.937250 well i- i have my own beef about health insurance i uh

Agent 182.369500 203.468625 [silence]
