Customer 12.757250 15.423000 [silence]

Agent 26.015125 27.268250 [silence]

Agent 27.268250 34.797250 yeah we don't we don't ever we don't carry a whole lot of cash with us so we use the the gas cards because_1 our families are both out of

Agent 37.840125 39.746875 use the gas cards

Agent 39.746875 41.505125 [silence]
Agent 41.505125 43.751625 yeah yeah
Customer 42.495500 53.339625 [silence]

Agent 57.025125 58.588250 yes a lot
Customer 57.285375 58.352750 wha[t]-
Customer 58.352750 62.352875 what uh criteria do you consider on whether or not you'll accept a particular card
Agent 58.588250 62.832250 [silence]
Customer 62.352875 71.729375 [silence]
Agent 62.832250 65.404625 uh probably the uh
Agent 65.404625 69.902125 uh if there's a premium each year and the uh
Agent 69.902125 70.952375 [silence]
Agent 70.952375 71.999125 the APR
Customer 71.729375 74.087000 yeah i won't get a card if there's an annual fee
Agent 71.999125 73.621250 [silence]
Agent 73.621250 77.143750 and there's it's it's kind of hard to beat TI
Customer 74.087000 76.547875 [silence]
Customer 76.547875 77.602750 right
Agent 77.143750 81.877750 and so uh you know usually we just trash it just tear it up and trash it an[d]-
Customer 77.602750 82.106000 [silence]
Agent 81.877750 83.858500 m[ost]- most of the time it goes unopened
Customer 82.106000 83.108000 yeah i
Customer 83.108000 83.971500 [silence]
Agent 83.858500 86.992500 [silence]
Customer 83.971500 88.829875 i- i think that Texan's is charging thirteen point nine percent uh interest
Agent 86.992500 88.620875 yeah if if that much
Agent 88.620875 92.525125 they're thirteen something but i'm not sure if it's i think it's a flat thirteen right now
Customer 88.829875 92.167500 [silence]
Customer 92.167500 97.107125 it could be could be i don't uh use them_1 often enough to even keep tabs on it
Agent 92.525125 96.691375 [silence]
Agent 96.691375 97.470625 yeah
Customer 97.107125 100.755500 but most of them charge between eighteen and twenty one percent per year
Agent 97.470625 99.840000 [silence]
Agent 99.840000 100.867875 yeah
Customer 100.755500 102.246875 i think that's
Agent 100.867875 107.555500 and then you['re]- then you're if you're that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year [laughter]
Customer 102.246875 106.982875 [silence]
Customer 106.982875 108.921750 right right
Agent 107.555500 112.096375 [silence]
Customer 108.921750 114.074625 and i look for a grace period too so that they don't charge interest on from from the day of purchase
Agent 112.096375 113.514250 yeah
Agent 113.514250 114.966250 yeah
Customer 114.074625 115.123000 [silence]
Agent 114.966250 117.635750 [silence]
Customer 115.123000 117.337250 and of course no annual fee
Customer 117.337250 124.247750 [silence]
Agent 117.635750 123.872875 yeah that would that would help a lot i i'm not even sure why i mean the purpose of an annual fee i'm not really
Agent 123.872875 128.846375 [silence]
Customer 124.247750 129.746500 well i- i think it just generates revenue for the companies that uh for the banks that sponsor the credit cards
Agent 128.846375 133.555125 well i guess so because_1 it's not any more prestigious to have to pay it
Customer 129.746500 136.191875 [silence]
Agent 133.555125 137.714625 uh as far as getting another card where you don't i mean you know
Customer 136.191875 137.368125 no
Customer 137.368125 139.366750 [silence]
Agent 137.714625 148.841125 [silence]
Customer 139.366750 149.141750 uh i get uh applications for cards from oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card
Agent 148.841125 150.149750 oh really
Customer 149.141750 155.385000 and uh the incentive there was that they'd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card
Agent 150.149750 155.104750 [silence]
Agent 155.104750 156.165375 yeah
Customer 155.385000 159.291125 so i got that card just so i could uh make a major purchase
Agent 156.165375 157.540000 [silence]
Agent 157.540000 159.972875 have ten percent off but you got to use that credit card
Customer 159.291125 161.020000 right and get a discount on it
Agent 159.972875 162.210750 right yeah that
Customer 161.020000 164.349000 i d[id]- did the same thing with uh Foley's they uh
Agent 162.210750 165.862750 [silence]
Customer 164.349000 168.855375 uh had a fifteen percent discount on a purchase if you just apply for a card
Agent 165.862750 166.942500 yeah
Agent 166.942500 168.340375 [silence]

Agent 177.547750 188.089500 and found some s[tuff]- stuff after Christmas on sale and ended up getting fifteen percent off already off of it already whatever it was lower and i think that's the only card i have that's
Customer 181.932625 183.735750 yeah uh-huh
Customer 183.735750 191.435250 [silence]
Agent 188.089500 198.944250 you know recently is gotten a Mervyn's card and i used it for i think for the first time when i was in Houston this weekend and i have i've had it for months

Customer 203.774125 208.078000 [silence]
Agent 205.807000 215.145625 [silence]
Customer 208.078000 217.084125 if you want to borrow money there're better ways to do it uh i think you can get a loan through the credit union for about uh oh i don't know nine or ten percent now i guess
Agent 215.145625 217.604500 yeah yeah
Customer 217.084125 222.202625 and uh keeping a credit cards uh charged up is just uh
Agent 217.604500 224.762625 [silence]
Customer 222.202625 226.513500 not a very good way to uh to ma[ke]- to make use of borrowing money
Agent 224.762625 233.200500 yeah i never understood how people could i mean there are some people who say well i can't charge it it's at it's limit and i thought God how can you charge a credit card to its limit
Customer 226.513500 240.489250 [silence]
Agent 233.200500 241.935375 it just it just i guess it's that that you know lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that says pay later you know
Customer 240.489250 245.135750 yeah it's the buy now pay later plan and uh live for today
Agent 241.935375 244.957750 yeah and i just it's that

Agent 247.878875 259.308000 yeah and it just i don't i don't really go for them_1 and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them_1 up just for the fact that TI had lower rates
Customer 248.786125 254.216500 [silence]
Customer 254.216500 255.125250 yeah
Customer 255.125250 258.656375 [silence]

Customer 281.179000 283.048000 yeah well there's a
Customer 283.048000 287.963375 a basic problem too with not using credit cards that they are good credit references
Agent 283.654875 293.495250 [silence]
Customer 287.963375 300.521625 when i closed on my house mortgage uh the mortgage company was looking for uh references credit references and i didn't have any credit cards charged up at all i keep the balance paid off so they make lousy credit reference then
Agent 293.495250 294.430000 yeah
Agent 294.430000 296.866500 [silence]
Agent 296.866500 297.610375 yeah
Agent 297.610375 299.985125 [silence]
Agent 299.985125 300.955750 yeah
Customer 300.521625 311.241875 [silence]
Agent 300.955750 307.723000 yeah they do but we we were in in that same boat a couple of years ago and they had said well

Customer 311.241875 312.376125 right

Agent 314.779500 316.788750 that's all we did
Customer 315.853375 318.810250 when the balance is zero it [laughter-doesn't] help much [laughter]
Agent 316.788750 317.836625 [silence]
Agent 317.836625 318.855125 right
Customer 318.810250 319.893375 [silence]
Agent 318.855125 324.973875 [silence]
Customer 319.893375 327.280000 i get a lot of uh pre approved applications from various organizations and i throw all those out
Agent 324.973875 330.551375 yeah and it's like well who are you to approve [laughter] something for me without my permission anyway
Customer 327.280000 329.587625 [silence]
Customer 329.587625 330.618875 right
Agent 330.551375 333.999250 but i think um i think what you can do as far as
Customer 330.618875 341.798625 [silence]
Agent 333.999250 336.115375 i don't think as many companies
Agent 336.115375 342.042625 when you are a good customer i don't think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers
Customer 341.798625 343.188250 right uh-huh
Agent 342.042625 347.911875 because a lot of times you have to write and ask them to report it to the credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit
Customer 343.188250 353.934750 [silence]
Agent 347.911875 349.325125 [silence]
Agent 349.325125 354.738625 as far as you know paying off you know your cards early or on time or whatever
Customer 353.934750 355.353625 yeah uh-huh
Agent 354.738625 363.008625 that usually doesn't happen unless i've heard people say well you have to write to ask that and i say well you know if someone's so quick to turn you over because you're thirty days late
Customer 355.353625 362.237250 [silence]
Customer 362.237250 363.078625 um-hum

Customer 363.078625 366.366375 [silence]
Agent 366.007250 373.530875 [silence]
Customer 366.366375 368.375500 yeah i think you're right

Agent 394.695000 404.772375 [silence]
Agent 404.772375 406.738500 the dollar you didn't cash
Customer 404.993000 406.113875 [silence]
