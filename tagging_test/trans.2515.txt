Customer 285.360375 294.687875 [silence]
Customer 294.687875 295.928250 uh-huh
Agent 295.735875 302.718000 standard we usually don't or if it it is a purchase uh then it's paid off when the bill comes
Customer 295.928250 314.707625 [silence]
Agent 302.718000 316.779625 you know so it isn't any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the uh store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so it's not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all
Customer 314.707625 317.113500 right that's good
Agent 316.779625 325.514250 and but that hasn't always been the case [laughter] so i'm kind of i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh

Agent 325.514250 333.958000 you know in the past and i don't have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer

Customer 346.043125 347.120125 yeah
Agent 346.984375 353.450875 [silence]
Customer 347.120125 357.934000 we did we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things and it seemed like we didn't have enough money when
Agent 353.450875 354.919875 hm
Agent 354.919875 359.470000 [silence]
Customer 357.934000 371.147500 things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget [vocalized-noise] well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month
Agent 359.470000 360.950250 uh-huh

Agent 375.763750 377.031000 uh-huh
Agent 377.031000 385.955500 [silence]
Customer 381.730750 392.377500 i don't even remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month let's say and um mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and
Agent 385.955500 387.347750 uh-huh
Agent 387.347750 393.715875 [silence]
Customer 392.377500 400.357625 some months it may be different it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing
Agent 393.715875 395.229875 uh-huh
Agent 395.229875 413.950000 [silence]
Customer 400.357625 409.301750 but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know
Customer 409.301750 417.037750 uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you don't really have much control over
Agent 413.950000 415.391375 yeah

Customer 419.207125 429.748875 the cash budget just fits right in there and [laughter] like i said if we don't have we we also set aside money for entertainment i mean it's but again it's a set amount every month
Agent 429.190000 430.781000 uh-huh
Customer 429.748875 434.025500 and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we

Agent 438.180000 450.418875 okay uh we're in the process of trying to buy a house do you know how did your budget work or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house
Customer 439.324125 449.893375 [silence]
Customer 449.893375 461.120625 well no not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didn't have to put down anything
Agent 450.418875 460.480625 [silence]
Agent 460.480625 461.879625 huh
Customer 461.120625 473.557625 so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
Agent 461.879625 473.039875 [silence]
Agent 473.039875 474.569125 oh okay

Customer 477.552000 497.823250 [silence]
Agent 478.940625 488.538000 uh yeah i- i just keep thinking all the time i mean it it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know
Agent 488.538000 499.043250 your priority at least mine is to save for the house but then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime
Customer 497.823250 500.070000 sure i know
Agent 499.043250 501.504375 [laughter]
