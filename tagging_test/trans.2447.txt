Agent 0.000000 18.759375 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 1.990625 [noise]
Customer 1.990625 12.488375 probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um
Customer 12.488375 20.493625 at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on
Agent 18.759375 21.736625 uh-huh none at all huh
Customer 20.493625 25.480875 right uh we used to have American Express and uh
Agent 21.736625 28.973625 [silence]

Customer 37.360375 49.971500 we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that uh of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we don't plan on keeping it the second year
Agent 40.211750 41.483250 uh-huh
Agent 41.483250 45.990875 [silence]
Agent 45.990875 47.495500 uh-huh
Agent 47.495500 48.998875 [silence]
Agent 48.998875 51.495750 yeah that
Customer 49.971500 54.244250 because_1 i'm pretty frugal about things like that
Agent 51.495750 53.254250 [silence]
Agent 53.254250 65.484875 that's what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we don't have to pay a a fee at all
Customer 54.244250 64.485625 [silence]
Customer 64.485625 66.232500 uh-huh
Agent 65.484875 66.495625 [silence]
Customer 66.232500 77.195625 [noise]
Agent 66.495625 78.319125 and that's wh[at]- i- i know people who don't have any credit cards at all and i'm always amazed [laughter] because i don't know how they can get by without them it doesn't seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit [laughter-card]
Customer 77.195625 91.999500 we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or
Agent 78.319125 88.331500 [silence]
Agent 88.331500 90.004875 uh-huh
Agent 90.004875 92.776250 [silence]
Customer 91.999500 106.373125 whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless you've left a credit card at the desk
Agent 92.776250 93.998625 uh-huh
Agent 93.998625 105.231625 [silence]
Agent 105.231625 106.490875 uh-huh
Customer 106.373125 111.652125 so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but
Agent 106.490875 110.986125 [silence]
Agent 110.986125 123.184250 yeah i like them_1 [noise] too with with us we've got insurance of course but due to my husband's work but by the time like two weeks ago we all got sick all four us and one kid had to go to the doctor twice
Customer 111.652125 126.425500 [silence]
Agent 123.184250 137.314375 and then all the other th[e]- the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars [laughter-yeah] and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i can't come up with
Customer 126.425500 129.266875 [laughter-oh] [laughter-my]
Customer 129.266875 131.286250 [silence]
Customer 131.286250 132.732125 uh-huh
Customer 132.732125 135.988000 [silence]
Customer 135.988000 139.320375 can you do that on a credit card
Agent 137.314375 149.075500 yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back
Customer 139.320375 141.989375 oh for heaven sakes
Customer 141.989375 143.996750 [silence]
Customer 143.996750 146.276625 for the drugs yeah
Customer 146.276625 148.234375 [silence]
Customer 148.234375 149.730500 uh-huh
Agent 149.075500 158.473375 you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month [laughter-whereas] you know then i got to wait for the re[st]- the rest of it to come back from Aetna but it basically floats
Customer 149.730500 152.759375 [silence]
Customer 152.759375 154.499875 uh-huh
Customer 154.499875 162.498375 [silence]
Agent 158.473375 168.182000 you know during the the time because_1 we've got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and that's usually enough time for the insurance to get back
Customer 162.498375 164.493375 oh uh-huh
Customer 164.493375 167.198250 [silence]
Customer 167.198250 168.696125 uh-huh
Agent 168.182000 182.175375 i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five Visa cards i can't belie[ve]- you know it's like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good
Customer 168.696125 171.999625 [silence]

Agent 263.441250 265.000375 uh-huh
Customer 263.457250 275.993625 the balance b[y]- the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so that's kind of been my motto
Agent 265.000375 272.238750 [silence]
Agent 272.238750 273.679750 um

Agent 391.968375 394.753125 [silence]
Agent 394.753125 396.723625 i guess
Agent 396.723625 398.496125 [silence]
Agent 398.496125 409.123125 it's just you kn[ow]- an[d]- when i think about that lad[y]- this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee
Customer 399.175500 402.740000 [silence]

Customer 410.993500 414.986750 [silence]
Customer 414.986750 416.719625 uh-huh

Customer 416.719625 419.220500 [silence]
Customer 419.220500 425.496375 for one twelve dollar check it's never quite made sense to me but then uh
Agent 420.504500 423.488750 for one twelve dollar check
Agent 423.488750 436.506125 [silence]
Customer 425.496375 436.784875 when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it
Agent 436.506125 439.480500 [laughter-gosh] [laughter]
Customer 436.784875 444.750000 so [noise] i don't know why he you know didn't go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but
Agent 439.480500 442.274500 [silence]
Agent 442.274500 443.495250 yeah
Agent 443.495250 447.989375 he's going to have a debt going out the ear [vocalized-noise]
Customer 444.750000 446.485000 uh-huh
Customer 446.485000 460.716250 i was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing [laughter] so we've we have a little problem with our gas card we're uh we've always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil and uh
Agent 447.989375 450.672375 [silence]
Agent 450.672375 452.220125 [laughter]
Agent 452.220125 458.778500 [silence]
Agent 458.778500 460.478125 uh-huh
Agent 460.478125 465.738000 [silence]
Customer 460.716250 471.474125 we it's very difficult to find their stations so i guess that's one reason why we use uh we've used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fuel even
Agent 465.738000 467.362250 uh uh-huh
Agent 467.362250 469.499125 [silence]
Agent 469.499125 470.972875 yeah
Agent 470.972875 484.499875 [noise] well we have a lot of Mobile stations around here and i used to use that card almost exclusively but now they're charging the extra five cents to use your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else
Customer 471.474125 488.667875 [silence]
Agent 484.499875 494.251750 is not anymore they'll take it you know at the cash price or you they'll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of um you know putting it off for a month
Customer 488.667875 490.490125 uh-huh
Customer 490.490125 492.801125 [silence]
Customer 492.801125 495.245500 i thought that was illegal
Agent 494.251750 495.988250 [silence]
Customer 495.245500 496.494750 [silence]
Agent 495.988250 498.211500 what's that writing a check for gas
Customer 496.494750 500.980625 no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card
Agent 498.211500 501.495375 [silence]
Customer 500.980625 502.207625 of
Agent 501.495375 507.757625 well all of them down down here you had a cash price for gasoline and a credit card price
Customer 502.207625 504.989375 [silence]
Customer 504.989375 513.993750 oh so what they're doing they're discounting for cash is the way they're because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so
Agent 507.757625 509.739000 [silence]
Agent 509.739000 513.339625 right that's that's supposedly
Agent 513.339625 517.290375 [silence]
Customer 513.993750 520.723750 that's that they're looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but
Agent 517.290375 518.278000 uh-huh
Agent 518.278000 519.488375 [silence]
Agent 519.488375 524.484875 right an[d]- and they've changed that now n[ow]- <b_aside> stop it go play and leave me alone <e_aside>

Agent 525.792375 534.971125 [laughter-yeah] and so i'm using the other ones now because they're just as easy to get to and then they're nickel a gallon cheaper so
Customer 531.967000 533.280625 yeah
Customer 533.280625 543.480500 um-hum so what we're saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if it's going to cost us money we don't though [laughter]
Agent 534.971125 539.040000 [silence]
Agent 539.040000 540.813000 yes

Customer 543.480500 546.218625 [laughter-probably]
Customer 546.218625 547.990375 [laughter]
Customer 547.990375 552.284625 and leave us [laughter]
Customer 552.284625 554.060625 uh-huh
Customer 554.060625 554.836875 [laughter]
