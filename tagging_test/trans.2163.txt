Customer 100.985000 102.306750 uh-huh

Agent 102.464875 113.994125 so but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards there's you know they have uh wonderful features they're there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever
Customer 110.006125 111.759625 yeah
Customer 111.759625 113.254625 huh
Customer 113.254625 120.727000 and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest it's like paying [laughter-twice]
Agent 113.994125 115.282375 [silence]
Agent 115.282375 119.710375 yeah they ta[lk]- talks with [vocalized-noise]
Agent 119.710375 122.247500 that's true that's true
Customer 120.727000 122.277000 yes
Agent 122.247500 123.991375 [silence]

Customer 123.498375 125.256500 so but
Agent 123.991375 127.710750 i try to i did switch to one uh
Customer 125.256500 131.297625 [silence]
Agent 127.710750 131.995125 sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest
Customer 131.297625 132.999875 oh uh-huh
Agent 131.995125 137.994375 yeah compared to some of the other ones and you don't have an annual fee there and that helps
Customer 132.999875 134.497750 yeah
Customer 134.497750 135.801125 yeah
Customer 135.801125 137.291000 [silence]
Customer 137.291000 151.784000 oh yes uh we used to have you know like several but right now we're just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
Agent 137.994375 139.267875 yeah
Agent 139.267875 146.234750 [silence]
Agent 146.234750 147.489625 uh-huh
Agent 147.489625 150.800000 [silence]
Agent 150.800000 159.475750 yeah that's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well i'll just pay on it this month and [laughter]
Customer 151.784000 154.240750 [silence]
Customer 154.240750 155.747500 yeah
Customer 155.747500 165.479625 pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time
Agent 159.475750 160.784125 yeah
Agent 160.784125 163.790250 [silence]
Agent 163.790250 171.765500 takes a long time that's right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that's you know
Customer 165.479625 167.478125 it sure does
Customer 167.478125 170.296125 [silence]
Customer 170.296125 171.993125 uh-huh
Agent 171.765500 177.478250 of course it's been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so
Customer 171.993125 173.737250 but yeah
Customer 173.737250 176.498000 [silence]
