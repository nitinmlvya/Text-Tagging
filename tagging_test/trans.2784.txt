Agent 0.000000 13.466875 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 0.477000 [silence]
Customer 0.477000 11.296375 i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i- i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i
Customer 11.296375 13.529000 i guess i get my money's worth for
Agent 13.466875 14.827500 okay
Customer 13.529000 14.699125 [silence]
Customer 14.699125 17.395750 i'm not sure though whether i feel
Agent 14.827500 27.378375 [silence]
Customer 17.395750 20.983000 i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though
Customer 20.983000 26.423875 uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas i[sn't]- isn't correct
Customer 26.423875 31.400125 [silence]
Agent 27.378375 32.070125 well i'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that
Customer 31.400125 32.713875 [laughter]
Agent 32.070125 35.237625 because_1 everybody has a different idea of where the money should go
Customer 32.713875 35.720625 [silence]
Agent 35.237625 59.976750 [silence]
Customer 35.720625 45.770250 well i- i lately i guess um uh or at least for the last t[wenty]- twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high
Customer 45.770250 53.282875 cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh there's been and extraordinary amount of
Customer 53.282875 57.555250 money spent there and i'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there
Customer 57.555250 62.530000 uh regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm uh Desert Shield uh situations
Agent 59.976750 61.085625 uh-huh
Agent 61.085625 62.278500 [silence]
Agent 62.278500 63.239625 yeah
Customer 62.530000 63.581250 [silence]
Agent 63.239625 78.555000 [silence]
Customer 63.581250 76.137500 uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi[litary]- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a
Customer 76.137500 78.995125 as a given in any military operation and
Agent 78.555000 80.773000 oh yeah no argument here
Customer 78.995125 80.238000 [silence]
Customer 80.238000 90.167875 yeah and i gue[ss]- i- i should imagine that that that what the what the problem why i i'm i'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and
Agent 80.773000 114.973500 [silence]
Customer 90.167875 97.911125 and easy i don't know i shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh Mideast uh uh over the uh Iraqis uh
Customer 97.911125 107.321500 might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe i'm i- i don't know what other foe that would be but
Customer 107.321500 114.235250 uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
Customer 114.235250 142.013625 [silence]
Agent 114.973500 126.609250 yeah well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the and the inventory's going to have to be restocked
Agent 126.609250 130.875625 uh on now i work for TI and one of the things we were told is
Agent 130.875625 137.203750 like they had eleven thousand Harm missiles which TI is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in in the war
Agent 137.203750 143.531750 so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed
Customer 142.013625 151.153750 yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i- i should imagine that
Agent 143.531750 172.458250 [silence]
Customer 151.153750 158.582500 that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated w[as]- was when
Customer 158.582500 163.022125 the Soviet threat i guess was perceived as being
Customer 163.022125 166.529250 a greater one i don't think there's very much of a threat there today
Customer 166.529250 173.834125 i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them but [laughter]
Agent 172.458250 174.989250 that that's true that's true
Customer 173.834125 179.910125 i- i don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything
Agent 174.989250 180.004625 [silence]
Customer 179.910125 181.819750 uh that would be irrational
Agent 180.004625 186.372250 well of of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks
Customer 181.819750 183.924875 [silence]
Customer 183.924875 185.409375 right
Customer 185.409375 186.677375 yeah
Agent 186.372250 193.029625 and uh uh uh TI also makes the [vocalized-noise] missile which was the the TV laser guided bombs
Customer 186.677375 192.969750 [silence]
Customer 192.969750 194.030125 yeah
Agent 193.029625 198.375625 and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that [vocalized-noise] that w[as]- that was just a matter of
Customer 194.030125 197.738375 [silence]
Customer 197.738375 199.551500 w[hat]- what is the name of that
Agent 198.375625 199.398750 [silence]
Agent 199.398750 200.896125 uh it's called Paveway
Customer 199.551500 200.663250 [silence]
Customer 200.663250 201.825375 yes yes
Agent 200.896125 202.246375 [silence]
Customer 201.825375 214.589750 [silence]
Agent 202.246375 206.580250 and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also
Agent 206.580250 208.570125 so tho[se]- those are two
Agent 208.570125 215.060500 areas in which TI stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that
Customer 214.589750 219.868750 yeah well i- i- i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and
Agent 215.060500 242.223750 [silence]
Customer 219.868750 226.918500 that that was an area that i- i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for
Customer 226.918500 234.928500 uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and it's
Customer 234.928500 243.048625 it's a cliche i- i but i see it myself i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways
Agent 242.223750 243.918750 oh no doubt
Customer 243.048625 252.341375 i- i- i don't know uh i kn[ow]- i'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas so i don't totally agree with the the great
Agent 243.918750 267.520750 [silence]
Customer 252.341375 262.337125 uh uh with the with the great ex[penditure]- expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh
Customer 262.337125 268.480375 and uh rural school systems are like i- i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure
Agent 267.520750 270.803625 yeah as a matter of fact in Texas um
Customer 268.480375 291.424000 [silence]
Agent 270.803625 275.056500 we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional
Agent 275.056500 277.415500 by the a state judge
Agent 277.415500 282.437875 and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill
Agent 282.437875 284.636625 which basically what it does
Agent 284.636625 292.435250 is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes
Customer 291.424000 292.937625 um-hum
Agent 292.435250 296.038500 and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent
Customer 292.937625 295.936250 [silence]
Customer 295.936250 301.782375 that they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or is it all funded out of local taxes
Agent 296.038500 299.502500 [silence]
Agent 299.502500 301.027000 uh well
Agent 301.027000 306.651875 okay to g[ive]- to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime
Customer 301.782375 310.474500 [silence]
Agent 306.651875 311.176125 in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds
Customer 310.474500 311.504000 yeah
Agent 311.176125 314.440250 then we had a number of education reforms
Customer 311.504000 325.856625 [silence]
Agent 314.440250 322.199000 that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget
Agent 322.199000 326.135250 the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts
Customer 325.856625 329.966250 sounds like the way the federal and state system works [laughter-now] yeah
Agent 326.135250 326.982375 so
Agent 326.982375 328.509500 [silence]
Agent 328.509500 329.864875 really so
Agent 329.864875 337.624750 so what ended up happening was was a was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years
Customer 329.966250 339.358625 [silence]
Agent 337.624750 339.317000 and uh
Agent 339.317000 340.205875 i mean
Customer 339.358625 341.763875 uh do you mean a a complete reversal
Agent 340.205875 341.228000 [silence]
Agent 341.228000 342.360625 oh complete
Customer 341.763875 351.547625 [silence]
Agent 342.360625 344.961000 complete it's all shifted to local districts
Agent 344.961000 348.262750 and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being
Agent 348.262750 350.963625 is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state
Agent 350.963625 355.838250 [silence]
Customer 351.547625 355.766875 because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh
Customer 355.766875 365.518500 [silence]
Agent 355.838250 358.840500 that's right and and i have i have no problem
Agent 358.840500 361.529500 with uh a certain
Agent 361.529500 373.068125 uh floor level minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh but i am opposed to
Customer 365.518500 366.454625 yeah
Customer 366.454625 381.550500 [silence]
Agent 373.068125 381.772125 [vocalized-noise] any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum
Customer 381.550500 391.077750 yes i see what you're saying uh i uh i- i do i- i guess i am a s[trong]- uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy
Agent 381.772125 402.459500 [silence]
Customer 391.077750 394.999125 for any forms of education i mean by that i mean
Customer 394.999125 403.003500 i'm a product myself i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the GI Bill
Agent 402.459500 404.763125 so did i my Master's anyway
Customer 403.003500 410.415500 what but [vocalized-noise] uh when i look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done
Agent 404.763125 412.968625 [silence]
Customer 410.415500 414.255125 i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial
Agent 412.968625 413.746500 yeah
Agent 413.746500 416.201875 [silence]
Customer 414.255125 416.695500 uh easement made possible
Agent 416.201875 417.061500 that's right
Customer 416.695500 421.723000 and i- i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an [vocalized-noise]
Agent 417.061500 438.012500 [silence]
Customer 421.723000 432.200000 [laughter-whether] [laughter-you're] [laughter-a] [laughter-veteran] or whether you i don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the
Customer 432.200000 433.514625 that that
Customer 433.514625 438.437750 the subsidy itself or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation
Agent 438.012500 439.240750 uh-huh
Customer 438.437750 448.742750 would give many people who i- i think i i think i perceive the fact at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their
Agent 439.240750 468.046875 [silence]
Customer 448.742750 460.152500 uh out of their uh budget i know in the state of Florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the
Customer 460.152500 470.893000 in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't i mean to me it doesn't sound like a [mot/lot] of money but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year they went from eleven to fifteen hundred
Agent 468.046875 469.726000 uh-huh
Agent 469.726000 471.496875 yeah
Customer 470.893000 476.790125 and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent i don't know what that would be
Agent 471.496875 476.218750 [silence]
Agent 476.218750 480.143125 yeah they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here
Customer 476.790125 480.244875 [silence]
Agent 480.143125 481.210750 a few years ago too
Customer 480.244875 487.124625 but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that
Agent 481.210750 495.053250 [silence]
Customer 487.124625 498.797500 that the program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now establish uh don't have enough money so they
Agent 495.053250 495.504500 uh-huh
Agent 495.504500 502.609875 [silence]
Customer 498.797500 503.262250 they must charge fees uh i- i i'm not too sure of that reasoning
Agent 502.609875 503.467125 yeah
Customer 503.262250 507.929125 but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes i
Agent 503.467125 529.509750 [silence]
Customer 507.929125 513.680625 i- i travel extensively in Europe and see enormous uh people p[ay]- pay uh a great deal
Customer 513.680625 517.341250 in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they
Customer 517.341250 520.650750 they some states they pay uh in Germany or in
Customer 520.650750 531.020500 in England in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes
Agent 529.509750 531.545750 oh oh i can believe that
Customer 531.020500 538.349500 but but i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax
Agent 531.545750 542.639000 [silence]
Customer 538.349500 546.165125 and these myriad of uh now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax
Agent 542.639000 543.590000 yep
Agent 543.590000 544.523625 yeah
Agent 544.523625 554.706250 [silence]
Customer 546.165125 554.941875 uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that
Agent 554.706250 559.444000 well i guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes i[f]- if uh the Democrats had
Customer 554.941875 560.426750 [silence]
Agent 559.444000 560.974125 more say
Customer 560.426750 562.109125 you really think so
Agent 560.974125 562.509875 yeah i really do
Customer 562.109125 568.124000 but i mean w[hat]- what's what's happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years
Agent 562.509875 571.886625 [silence]
Customer 568.124000 574.951000 uh my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down i pay [vocalized-noise] uh quite a bit more taxes and and and
Agent 571.886625 572.785875 yeah

Agent 574.239750 575.782125 every everybody is
Customer 574.951000 577.955125 but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years
Agent 575.782125 577.441875 [silence]
Agent 577.441875 581.014125 well what what what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase
Customer 577.955125 582.372250 [silence]
