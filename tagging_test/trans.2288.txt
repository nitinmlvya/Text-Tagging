Agent 31.979625 52.392250 [silence]
Customer 42.304375 50.853875 what we do i guess is we try to proportion uh who pays what according to the salary that we make

Agent 80.726125 89.855625 we we've got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month
Agent 89.855625 97.962000 and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately there's a big category called miscellaneous
Customer 97.099875 102.094125 oh [laughter] that one gets used up quick is that it [laughter]
Agent 97.962000 100.265125 and uh misc[ellaneous]-
Agent 100.265125 104.872000 that's the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we
Customer 102.094125 112.468375 [laughter]
Agent 104.872000 112.709500 figure it's going to be it's never what it was last month and uh and uh you know it's it's the one that's always the killer
Customer 112.468375 114.696500 that's [laughter]
Agent 112.709500 121.125750 um but i uh you know it's uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we

Customer 130.898750 145.567375 [silence]
Agent 135.963375 146.109875 go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category we're paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our money's going we don't have any control over it
Customer 145.567375 148.578875 [laughter]
Agent 146.109875 149.595125 but we have a real good sense of where it's going [laughter]
Customer 148.578875 155.574125 well but you know that's good too because i've been in the situation in the past where i didn't know where my money was going and that
Agent 149.595125 155.433875 [silence]
Agent 155.433875 156.304625 yeah

Customer 185.401375 193.651125 [silence]
Agent 185.848250 190.415875 and and what we've proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month
Agent 190.415875 198.964500 is that we're spending more than than we make [laughter] so it's it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah

Customer 353.057000 354.380125 but
Customer 354.380125 363.997375 you know but at least i can see a little bit of the light just from you know doing this you know budgeting and stuff it really helps
Agent 354.907750 361.022500 [silence]
Agent 361.022500 362.059625 yeah
Agent 362.059625 363.099875 right

Agent 364.407375 370.637625 yeah um and and and it also makes it possible
Customer 365.055250 379.455375 [silence]
Agent 370.637625 374.483500 you i think before we did any kind of budgeting
Agent 374.483500 380.010500 w[e]- we we were in we were in a constant state of saying we can't afford anything
Customer 379.455375 381.100000 right
Agent 380.010500 384.958875 you know we can't do anything we can't afford anything and now
Customer 381.100000 398.994250 [silence]
Agent 384.958875 388.883375 we can at least say well we can fit this in
Agent 388.883375 399.580125 it's it doesn't really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldn't before
Customer 398.994250 401.720250 yeah it really makes a world of difference doesn't it
Agent 399.580125 400.974750 [silence]

Customer 401.720250 406.934000 it really does i know i've been in like i said the same situation you know where i've
Agent 402.015250 411.398625 [silence]
Customer 406.934000 418.717625 i've been in a situation where i didn't budget anything just spent money and spent money and spent [laughter-money] and it doesn't work [laughter] it doesn't it really doesn't uh makes a big difference
Agent 411.398625 412.567375 right
Agent 412.567375 413.739000 [silence]
Agent 413.739000 416.956250 that's right that's right [laughter] it it it
Agent 416.956250 418.998625 [silence]
Customer 418.717625 430.932875 [silence]
Agent 418.998625 421.637250 yeah i we i think that uh
Agent 421.637250 428.071375 part of the uh the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that
Agent 428.071375 431.566250 that there were those years where we lived that way
Customer 430.932875 432.479250 yes
Agent 431.566250 433.142000 and we're still paying for it
Customer 432.479250 436.441625 oh definitely [laughter]
Agent 433.142000 437.006375 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and so the only way to get out
Customer 436.441625 440.512625 [silence]
Agent 437.006375 440.645000 from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting

Agent 440.645000 441.864250 um
Customer 441.522125 449.437375 [silence]

Customer 449.437375 451.479500 [laughter]
Customer 451.479500 453.497250 [silence]
