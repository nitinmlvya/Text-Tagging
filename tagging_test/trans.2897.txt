Agent 0.000000 5.283875 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 1.012125 [noise]
Customer 1.012125 2.382625 [silence]
Customer 2.382625 5.501000 what do you think about the benefits in jobs
Agent 5.283875 7.996250 um i'm i'm
Customer 5.501000 15.198875 [silence]
Agent 7.996250 16.063750 r[elatively]- relatively satisfied with the benefits i have i think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive
Customer 15.198875 16.660625 uh-huh
Agent 16.063750 22.436250 i'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less [laughter-money]
Customer 16.660625 27.282875 [silence]
Agent 22.436250 27.477000 but um you know that's that's my major complaint i guess what about you
Customer 27.282875 33.317875 yeah and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you paying for all of it
Agent 27.477000 32.856375 [silence]
Agent 32.856375 34.175375 uh-huh
Customer 33.317875 39.959750 [silence]
Agent 34.175375 35.180625 [silence]
Agent 35.180625 40.955750 or or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't
Customer 39.959750 41.440750 uh-huh
Agent 40.955750 42.119750 [silence]
Customer 41.440750 42.670375 yeah
Agent 42.119750 44.377000 yeah i
Customer 42.670375 55.407750 right the the health insurance i have is MetLife and if it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then uh you just pay ten dollars and then uh the insurance pays the rest of the bill
Agent 44.377000 59.755125 [silence]
Customer 55.407750 59.557000 or if you go outside you get uh seventy thirty
Customer 59.557000 82.207750 [silence]
Agent 59.755125 61.314375 i see
Agent 61.314375 68.969375 now we i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what i found recently is
Agent 68.969375 73.689375 what they've been doing is they they poll somehow the area
Agent 73.689375 83.092000 and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code
Customer 82.207750 83.477000 uh-huh
Agent 83.092000 87.134750 and so recently when when we had a claim
Customer 83.477000 111.965750 [silence]
Agent 87.134750 100.425750 um they didn't pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower and when i called they said oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area and i was really surprised because
Agent 100.425750 107.983625 either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out
Agent 107.983625 112.471500 or their you know their statistics aren't very accurate
Customer 111.965750 116.902875 right and and they're probably doing it to their benefit anyway so
Agent 112.471500 116.727375 [silence]
Agent 116.727375 123.563500 yeah i would assume that you [laughter-know] whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in
Customer 116.902875 122.670500 [silence]
Customer 122.670500 124.106875 uh-huh
Agent 123.563500 130.710000 but it's it's difficult What about other other benefits are there others that you're dissatisfied with
Customer 124.106875 129.823625 [silence]
Customer 129.823625 137.982250 well i work for Sears and and um that's about the the only real benefit you have is health insurance
Agent 130.710000 137.063250 [silence]
Agent 137.063250 139.596000 well you have vacation i mean
Customer 137.982250 148.192125 yeah yeah but everybody gets vacation i mean like uh TI and some other places you know they have so[cial]- recreational facilities and
Agent 139.596000 153.924375 [silence]
Customer 148.192125 154.574375 they have a driving range and weight room and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and
Agent 153.924375 155.986000 huh
Customer 154.574375 157.818125 i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that
Agent 155.986000 157.910250 [silence]
Customer 157.818125 158.905875 [silence]
Agent 157.910250 160.968000 yeah i'm not familiar with that sort of thing but
Customer 158.905875 163.047250 [noise]
Agent 160.968000 171.182875 but you know to me vacation [laughter] is is an issue and i mean different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume
Customer 163.047250 165.172750 [silence]
Customer 165.172750 166.550250 uh-huh
Customer 166.550250 170.186250 [silence]
Customer 170.186250 171.655625 right
Agent 171.182875 178.418250 and um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um
Customer 171.655625 188.542875 [silence]
Agent 178.418250 179.425750 [silence]
Agent 179.425750 189.391625 um i don't know i suppose um sick days some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you
Customer 188.542875 190.202500 uh-huh
Agent 189.391625 199.616000 um ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill
Customer 190.202500 198.618625 [silence]
Customer 198.618625 199.867875 right
Agent 199.616000 201.362250 right
Customer 199.867875 216.794500 [silence]
Agent 201.362250 205.136750 but um otherwise
Agent 205.136750 210.567750 i'm not not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
Agent 210.567750 213.764625 [silence]
Agent 213.764625 217.294625 so maybe that covers the topic then
Customer 216.794500 224.131625 yeah well i don't know the worki[ng]- the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits
Agent 217.294625 226.655500 [silence]
Customer 224.131625 227.340000 some places aren't very safe to work
Agent 226.655500 227.917375 uh-huh
Customer 227.340000 233.682250 and and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you that you have to work under
Agent 227.917375 233.063500 [silence]
Agent 233.063500 243.493000 uh-huh or maybe a ben[efit]- uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls
Customer 233.682250 242.418250 [silence]
Customer 242.418250 244.126250 right uh-huh
Agent 243.493000 244.953125 um
Customer 244.126250 249.963000 [silence]
Agent 244.953125 250.722000 um but you know i suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others
Customer 249.963000 252.179250 yeah i think so
Agent 250.722000 252.903875 [silence]
Customer 252.179250 259.414875 [silence]
Agent 252.903875 259.889500 and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules
Customer 259.414875 261.685750 uh-huh
Agent 259.889500 263.911750 [silence]
Customer 261.685750 273.155500 [silence]
Agent 263.911750 275.637000 but other than that i don't have much feeling for [laughter] for the benefits since like i said um i don't have a big problem with with them i
Customer 273.155500 279.929500 um Workm[en]- Workmen's Comp is a big thing now in in Texas because um
Agent 275.637000 282.486375 [silence]
Customer 279.929500 287.365250 um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
Agent 282.486375 284.537375 uh-huh
Agent 284.537375 300.025000 [silence]
Customer 287.365250 291.782625 and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and uh
Customer 291.782625 299.732625 and i don't know besides that but i i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing
Customer 299.732625 305.302000 [silence]
Agent 300.025000 306.070375 oh i uh i didn't know that somebody could avoid Workmen's Compensation
Customer 305.302000 311.255125 well well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state
Agent 306.070375 310.058750 [silence]
Agent 310.058750 312.027875 oh i see
Customer 311.255125 313.999250 so apparently it costs less that way
Agent 312.027875 313.322500 [silence]
Agent 313.322500 315.331250 uh-huh uh-huh
Customer 313.999250 323.637500 [silence]
Agent 315.331250 324.596875 i suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits it's to the to to the benefit of the company [laughter]
Customer 323.637500 325.340750 uh-huh
Agent 324.596875 333.627375 and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think that they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them
Customer 325.340750 332.707250 [silence]
Customer 332.707250 340.445750 yeah that's what i what i think the[y]- they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
Agent 333.627375 348.792000 [silence]
Customer 340.445750 349.356125 and how much profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people
Agent 348.792000 357.057000 right i mean sure the payroll is lower that way but i would assume that the productivity is way down also
Customer 349.356125 355.665125 [silence]
Customer 355.665125 364.926750 yeah the productivity and the training costs if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i don't see how they can save money
Agent 357.057000 364.070625 [silence]
Agent 364.070625 365.860750 uh-huh uh-huh
Customer 364.926750 369.903750 you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
Agent 365.860750 369.749500 [silence]
Agent 369.749500 371.327125 that's right
Customer 369.903750 372.672875 [silence]
Agent 371.327125 373.104000 no i agree
Customer 372.672875 376.253250 yeah okay it was nice talking to you
Agent 373.104000 375.137375 [silence]
Agent 375.137375 378.135375 well thank you for calling bye-bye
Customer 376.253250 377.867750 yeah bye-bye
Customer 377.867750 380.086375 [noise]
Agent 378.135375 380.086375 [noise]
