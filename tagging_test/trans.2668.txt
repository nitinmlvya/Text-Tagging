Agent 330.027750 334.713875 [silence]
Agent 334.713875 342.071500 [vocalized-noise] i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldn't have so much money going to so many different schools
Customer 335.204500 341.797625 [silence]
Customer 341.797625 355.792250 yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching
Agent 342.071500 348.827125 [silence]
Agent 348.827125 350.405375 yeah

Customer 380.199250 395.007000 [laughter] yeah yeah we get we get fat in [laughter-those] [laughter-areas] and yeah and and and and we got they they got a lot of overhead in those schools and rather than throw more money at it they got to figure out how to get get the most out of the people that they got
Agent 382.067625 383.072125 [silence]
Agent 383.072125 386.665625 yeah and then all your money goes to overhead
