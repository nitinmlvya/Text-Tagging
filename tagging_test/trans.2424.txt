Customer 56.198000 61.104500 [silence]
Agent 56.993000 58.063750 [silence]

Agent 61.605250 62.672750 [silence]
Customer 62.557625 65.124750 [silence]

Agent 65.266125 73.243500 [silence]
Customer 71.055875 73.995875 that's not what i would consider a luxury
Agent 73.243500 80.509375 no uh [vocalized-noise] fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury but it's a necessity today
Customer 73.995875 92.210625 [silence]
Agent 80.509375 85.319500 and uh as hard as they try to get these
Agent 85.319500 93.247125 public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that uh re[ally]- really got off the ground
Customer 92.210625 93.508625 yeah
Agent 93.247125 97.048375 or that accomplish what they set out to accom[plish]- to accomplish
Customer 93.508625 100.672500 [silence]
Agent 97.048375 98.344625 [silence]
Agent 98.344625 100.226375 what are your feelings on it
Agent 100.226375 126.050250 [silence]
Customer 100.672500 109.615375 well um i- i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and
Customer 109.615375 117.249750 how it's being managed and so forth i mean i- i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money
Customer 117.249750 127.026750 it's totally out of our hands so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and and
Agent 126.050250 133.475250 yeah that that's that's so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day
Customer 127.026750 132.980875 [silence]
Customer 132.980875 134.661625 but not really
Agent 133.475250 137.206000 no you don't look what happened on the last presidential election
Customer 134.661625 141.667125 [laughter]
Agent 137.206000 139.442250 read my lips
Agent 139.442250 140.531875 [silence]
Agent 140.531875 144.002000 and what happened they turned around and double crossed us
Customer 141.667125 143.235500 [silence]
Customer 143.235500 144.544250 yeah
Agent 144.002000 145.200250 [silence]
Customer 144.544250 149.921875 [silence]
Agent 145.200250 149.160625 so uh i mean you you can't believe what you what you hear
Agent 149.160625 173.055500 [silence]
Customer 149.921875 160.070500 well i think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and
Customer 160.070500 161.731375 that
Customer 161.731375 167.406000 don't seem to have any validity at all i mean they're always far out and
Customer 167.406000 169.917375 uh you know they're studying some
Customer 169.917375 171.549500 obscure
Customer 171.549500 180.001250 uh bug [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-in] [laughter-some] [laughter-other] [laughter-part] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-world] or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think that's wrong
Agent 173.055500 174.302750 oh
Agent 174.302750 175.604375 [silence]
Agent 175.604375 177.382125 uh yes
Agent 177.382125 180.142250 [silence]
Customer 180.001250 181.086875 i
Agent 180.142250 183.332000 [vocalized-noise] i agree and and uh
Customer 181.086875 190.542750 [silence]
Agent 183.332000 189.041250 uh i also think we extend too much help to other uh countries we need
Agent 189.041250 191.572625 enough help here in this country
Customer 190.542750 191.994375 that's right
Agent 191.572625 195.830125 they're still people starving people here why should we help starving people somewhere else
Customer 191.994375 196.128375 [silence]
Agent 195.830125 206.219500 [silence]
Customer 196.128375 198.992875 yeah and i think here lately they've
Customer 198.992875 206.378625 been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize that we're the nation in trouble
Agent 206.219500 207.670625 abs[olutely]- absolutely
Customer 206.378625 223.242500 [silence]
Agent 207.670625 213.885125 now i can't wait for uh i- i could just picture wha[t's]- what's going to happen here in the not to distant future
Agent 213.885125 219.414875 we keep hearing well we're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh
Agent 219.414875 221.382875 uh uh the
Agent 221.382875 222.407625 [silence]
Agent 222.407625 225.713875 uh uh the the the big war over there in the Mideast
Customer 223.242500 224.980000 the war
Customer 224.980000 226.221125 um-hum
Agent 225.713875 230.487500 and uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything and uh
Customer 226.221125 234.791000 [silence]
Agent 230.487500 235.263500 the next thing you know we'll be t[urning]- turning around just like we did to Poland and say well just forget it
Customer 234.791000 236.197125 yeah
Agent 235.263500 240.013750 [silence]
Customer 236.197125 239.639500 and i think that's a mistake
Customer 239.639500 245.689625 somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away
Agent 240.013750 241.378750 [noise] oh definitely
Agent 241.378750 246.589500 [silence]
Customer 245.689625 257.798250 [silence]
Agent 246.589500 249.303250 well another thing now they they keep the
Agent 249.303250 258.912000 decontrolling different things first it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association and what not
Customer 257.798250 260.235625 we know what trouble they got into [laughter]
Agent 258.912000 264.673125 exactly and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled
Customer 260.235625 278.772125 [silence]
Agent 264.673125 270.117250 and and uh uh transcontinental or u[m]- u[m]- u[m]- u[m]- interstate
Agent 270.117250 271.567125 uh trucking
Agent 271.567125 272.617125 [silence]
Agent 272.617125 279.759625 i mean as soon as the uh the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket
Customer 278.772125 280.133250 yeah
Agent 279.759625 283.685250 uh prices went uh sky high
Customer 280.133250 301.323750 [silence]
Agent 283.685250 292.636250 you know in the in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive and they cut each others throats until they're they're reach the point where they're cutting their own throat
Agent 292.636250 294.186250 [silence]
Agent 294.186250 298.978375 and uh well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it th[at]- that's government controlled
Agent 298.978375 299.990875 [silence]
Agent 299.990875 301.061000 but um
Agent 301.061000 340.375250 [silence]
Customer 301.323750 308.322125 well i- i think another thing too that um i've had a little contacted with
Customer 308.322125 316.764250 uh in regard to taxes let's say that um you have something that the IRS
Customer 316.764250 326.641625 disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that well i think they're very unfair in the amount of
Customer 326.641625 331.575375 penalties and interest that they can attach to that
Customer 331.575375 339.070000 because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double
Customer 339.070000 341.665375 that amount and
Agent 340.375250 342.792000 oh by the time you get through with the uh
Customer 341.665375 345.654375 yes and that's to me there's something wrong there you know
Agent 342.792000 344.615125 [silence]
Agent 344.615125 345.918625 the penalties
Customer 345.654375 353.480125 yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time
Agent 345.918625 353.042750 [silence]
Agent 353.042750 357.806625 uh i agree i think the IRS is uh just too powerful
Customer 353.480125 362.895875 [silence]
Agent 357.806625 360.790875 there should be some sort of a control on it
Agent 360.790875 363.363125 and they should be a little more humane
Customer 362.895875 365.357250 um-hum absolutely
Agent 363.363125 364.989375 [silence]
Agent 364.989375 369.619375 uh the um well typical bureaucratic i guess
Customer 365.357250 376.380500 [silence]
Agent 369.619375 372.207750 uh that's that's one of my pet peeves
Agent 372.207750 376.970625 [noise] i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh the budget
Customer 376.380500 377.553625 um-hum
Agent 376.970625 385.363625 very simple give uh uh uh government employees the average number of of uh holidays as the uh
Customer 377.553625 385.041250 [silence]
Customer 385.041250 387.831875 [laughter]
Agent 385.363625 387.949000 uh the private industry
Customer 387.831875 388.615875 yeah
Agent 387.949000 392.589750 i mean you think about it now they they get about sixteen holidays a year
Customer 388.615875 392.550250 [silence]
Customer 392.550250 393.906125 that's a lot
Agent 392.589750 393.634875 [silence]
Agent 393.634875 397.826125 it sure is and i think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten
Customer 393.906125 397.005500 [silence]
Customer 397.005500 399.158750 well i haven't counted
Agent 397.826125 402.780125 [silence]
Customer 399.158750 403.396375 i- i would have guessed eight even but you might be right i don't have any idea
Agent 402.780125 409.541625 well i remember uh thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average maybe even a little more
Customer 403.396375 411.368500 [silence]
Agent 409.541625 412.274125 a day or so more than the average
Customer 411.368500 412.553875 yeah
Agent 412.274125 416.065500 but uh government is ridiculous
Customer 412.553875 415.111000 [silence]
Customer 415.111000 416.524875 wow
Agent 416.065500 418.530875 just think of the money they could save
Customer 416.524875 420.732875 [silence]
Agent 418.530875 421.460500 i mean they're they're paying out this money anyway
Customer 420.732875 421.895750 yeah
Agent 421.460500 423.513500 why not get the work out of the people
Customer 421.895750 422.897750 [silence]
Customer 422.897750 424.036875 yeah
Agent 423.513500 425.507875 [silence]
Customer 424.036875 446.990000 [silence]
Agent 425.507875 430.010375 and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes
Agent 430.010375 431.321750 [silence]
Agent 431.321750 436.476500 but uh as far as income tax is concerned i can't complain too much about it um
Agent 436.476500 439.773625 i'm single i have no
Agent 439.773625 443.732125 uh dependents or anything my children are all grown
Agent 443.732125 447.408000 and they're out worrying about their own income taxes
Customer 446.990000 448.270750 yeah
Agent 447.408000 479.075625 [silence]
Customer 448.270750 453.296250 well i- i have another thing that i thought about too um
Customer 453.296250 459.871250 for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is
Customer 459.871250 464.981250 and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but
Customer 464.981250 472.440000 here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it
Customer 472.440000 480.146625 so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much
Agent 479.075625 481.825375 um very true that's
Customer 480.146625 483.127750 you know it's kind of a vicious circle there
Agent 481.825375 482.931625 [silence]
Agent 482.931625 488.455250 and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it IRA's or something and and w[hen]-
Customer 483.127750 488.264000 [silence]
Customer 488.264000 490.815750 and then they took that away as far as
Agent 488.455250 489.948875 when you turn
Agent 489.948875 490.991000 [silence]
Customer 490.815750 491.902250 being
Agent 490.991000 494.765375 when you turn sixty five why then you pay the tax on it
Customer 491.902250 496.979375 [silence]
Agent 494.765375 497.317875 and the tax is a lot less
Customer 496.979375 498.070000 yeah
Agent 497.317875 498.561250 [silence]
Customer 498.070000 515.217875 [silence]
Agent 498.561250 501.341250 but in the mean time you u[sed]- used them
Agent 501.341250 503.777125 you've got your money tide up
Agent 503.777125 507.280250 in a low relatively low interest
Agent 507.280250 510.652125 uh bearing investment
Agent 510.652125 515.878500 i mean it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today
Customer 515.217875 516.335250 huh-uh
Agent 515.878500 517.507750 [silence]
Customer 516.335250 520.525625 [silence]
Agent 517.507750 520.987625 um me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it
Customer 520.525625 523.165875 [laughter]
Agent 520.987625 526.440000 [silence]
