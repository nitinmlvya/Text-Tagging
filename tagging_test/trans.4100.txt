Agent 0.000000 25.136375 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 0.180000 [noise]
Customer 0.180000 6.221625 uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because i'm now in the middle of a job search graduating here
Customer 6.221625 13.963625 and realizing that one of the things that's not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will
Customer 13.963625 25.461750 have some set of benefits where ever she's working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental it's something that i've been uh looking for
Agent 25.136375 36.540250 that's true one of the really disturbing things for me is uh is the way that the government mandates that all insurance policies include particular benefits
Customer 25.461750 40.700000 [silence]
Agent 36.540250 46.369125 uh even though you could you might never have any need for them_1 uh here in Georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy
Customer 40.700000 42.046750 [noise]
Customer 42.046750 52.241875 [silence]
Agent 46.369125 56.171125 must include coverage for mammograms and pap smears doesn't matter that you're single and male you still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears
Customer 52.241875 53.261250 [noise]
Customer 53.261250 56.685625 [silence]
Agent 56.171125 63.043375 and uh [laughter] it's that kind of thing that uh uh that bothers me
Customer 56.685625 59.456625 that's amusing [laughter] yeah
Customer 59.456625 62.310750 [silence]
Customer 62.310750 74.805375 yeah i think we have a similar thing in California and i think that at the moment you can't issue health insurance that doesn't have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and
Agent 63.043375 72.110375 [silence]
Agent 72.110375 77.981625 uh drug treat[ment]- yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah that's the same thing here even if you're
Customer 74.805375 79.670500 and the result is a lot of people won't provide it at all or over charge
Agent 77.981625 84.429625 even if you're a Mormon you still have to have uh coverage for smoking recovery you [laughter-know]
Customer 79.670500 83.581000 [noise]
Customer 83.581000 84.998625 yeah
Agent 84.429625 91.523250 uh but but in general your idea about flexibility i think is a very good one because uh
Customer 84.998625 105.934875 [silence]
Agent 91.523250 96.222500 uh if y[ou]- if you have a a full gamut of
Agent 96.222500 108.887125 of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company [vocalized-noise] is wi[lling]- willing to pay for but that you're simply not interested in and what you ra[ther]- prefer to do is say
Customer 105.934875 107.245375 yeah
Customer 107.245375 113.864875 [silence]
Agent 108.887125 114.734250 don't get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something
Customer 113.864875 125.685750 the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but
Agent 114.734250 124.137500 [silence]
Agent 124.137500 125.433500 right
Agent 125.433500 148.130625 [silence]
Customer 125.685750 134.345375 it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way
Customer 134.345375 139.075250 we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place
Customer 139.075250 148.831250 because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them_1 will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other one'll pay for the medical
Agent 148.130625 149.654750 um-hum
Customer 148.831250 153.197500 instead it's it's very much designed towards self only insurance
Agent 149.654750 156.661750 [silence]
Customer 153.197500 157.124250 i don't know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are
Agent 156.661750 161.924000 yeah i think that uh a a lot of them_1 are that way they uh th[ey]-
Customer 157.124250 173.107375 [silence]
Agent 161.924000 171.095750 they dea[l]- they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness who's the primary [carrer/carrier] and who's the secondary carrier but um
Agent 171.095750 179.584625 uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and it's very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh
Customer 173.107375 173.939500 [laughter]
Customer 173.939500 174.942250 yeah
Customer 174.942250 189.060125 [silence]
Agent 179.584625 189.680500 the coverage for the employee is is completely paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty eight dollars a month
Customer 189.060125 190.816375 well that's pretty good
Agent 189.680500 201.954625 it is i'm very pleased uh i think uh very pleased with the benefit package that we have that has uh uh a dental check ups are completely covered um
Customer 190.816375 192.744000 [silence]
Customer 192.744000 194.004250 [laughter]
Customer 194.004250 226.884500 [silence]
Agent 201.954625 215.158375 there's a lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the first dollar particularly if you chose low cost alternatives like out patient treatment rather than inpatient and uh things like that
Agent 215.158375 228.093375 um they have good educational benefits if you want to uh try to improve your uh you know g[o]- work further on a degree or or get a master's degree of something uh uh course
Customer 226.884500 235.343625 that's something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives
Agent 228.093375 234.842125 [silence]
Agent 234.842125 236.356875 um-hum
Customer 235.343625 243.735000 i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research
Agent 236.356875 266.346875 [silence]
Customer 243.735000 250.858250 so in fact you're saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh
Customer 250.858250 260.132000 physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits
Customer 260.132000 269.574250 and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that
Agent 266.346875 267.762625 um-hum
Agent 267.762625 280.531125 [silence]
Customer 269.574250 270.581625 [silence]
Customer 270.581625 282.225250 um one thing i was wondering is something i've noticed that that they don't publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort
Agent 280.531125 283.212625 yeah we don't have that either
Customer 282.225250 283.169000 hm
Customer 283.169000 291.010875 [silence]
Agent 283.212625 291.344000 uh in in some ways i think it's it would be very good thing uh you know to be able to get your wills done and
Customer 291.010875 292.259875 yeah
Agent 291.344000 298.850000 and uh advice just by picking up the phone or without having to actually uh you know pay somebody ex[tra]-
Customer 292.259875 298.850000 [silence]
