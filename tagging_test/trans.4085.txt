Customer 38.963000 44.806625 what do you think people's concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care
Agent 44.203625 55.095250 i swear that's what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um
Customer 44.806625 80.579500 [silence]
Agent 55.095250 55.547625 [noise]
Agent 55.547625 65.327125 yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university
Agent 65.327125 68.572625 and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um
Agent 68.572625 69.201375 [noise]
Agent 69.201375 75.676750 uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh wh[at]- you know the the uh
Agent 75.676750 76.026375 [noise]
Agent 76.026375 80.946750 uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly
Customer 80.579500 81.693375 oh yeah
Agent 80.946750 91.480625 [silence]
Customer 81.693375 82.911375 yeah
Customer 82.911375 91.998250 well we've our benefits have changed recently to where we have network doctors and network hospitals kind of uh a preferred provider
Agent 91.480625 92.428000 uh-huh

Agent 95.651875 96.478500 huh

Agent 96.478500 100.969625 [silence]
Agent 100.969625 101.910375 right
Customer 101.419250 108.081875 and uh so there uh you your benefits are reduced if you don't go to a network doctor
Agent 101.910375 106.006250 [silence]
Agent 106.006250 106.943000 well
Agent 106.943000 112.069625 do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not
Customer 108.081875 111.631875 [silence]
Customer 111.631875 112.535500 that's right
Agent 112.069625 113.134000 [silence]
Customer 112.535500 116.105250 that's right you get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors
Agent 113.134000 113.645750 huh
Agent 113.645750 116.141500 [silence]
Customer 116.105250 122.735375 [silence]
Agent 116.141500 124.076625 right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didn't require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right
Customer 122.735375 129.117625 no no the the plan allows you to do either one the benefits that are paid are considerably better
Agent 124.076625 130.339250 [silence]
Customer 129.117625 130.732500 when uh
Agent 130.339250 132.203000 with the preferred provider
Customer 130.732500 133.470250 we are with the preferred provider yes
Agent 132.203000 133.407250 huh
Agent 133.407250 146.296875 wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMO's just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs
Customer 133.470250 186.927500 [silence]
Agent 146.296875 155.723250 and it worked to some degree but it didn't work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMO's are are those that have uh
Agent 155.723250 167.804875 you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean it's obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the HMO
Agent 167.804875 180.725750 so you get the people in the H O they they don't uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh
Agent 180.725750 186.410375 you you have almost as many claims so uh that's that's caused a problem uh
Agent 186.410375 190.845125 [silence]
Customer 186.927500 191.245125 have you heard about uh ca[feteria]- the cafeteria plan of benefits
Agent 190.845125 197.879125 yes uh i don't think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs
Customer 191.245125 195.413000 [silence]
Customer 195.413000 196.781000 [laughter]
Customer 196.781000 198.031250 [silence]
Agent 197.879125 203.226250 [silence]
Customer 198.031250 203.637000 well i don't know i i would i'd be interested in see[ing]- in learning more about that because
Agent 203.226250 204.186750 uh-huh
Customer 203.637000 212.167750 uh i have no children so i am not interested really in child care benefits except i suppose as a citizen of the world or something [laughter]
Agent 204.186750 205.655000 [silence]
Agent 205.655000 206.724375 uh-huh
Agent 206.724375 208.440000 [silence]
Agent 208.440000 209.372875 right
Agent 209.372875 211.340875 [silence]
Agent 211.340875 216.977000 well i i don't know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh
Customer 212.167750 231.988125 [silence]
Agent 216.977000 231.920750 if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more
Agent 231.920750 233.720000 [silence]
Customer 231.988125 233.231500 yeah
Customer 233.231500 239.332625 yeah i just i i like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are more important to you
Agent 233.720000 234.543500 so
Agent 234.543500 238.334125 [silence]
Agent 238.334125 247.210375 oh yes no that that that it's true that's that's important i agree uh yeah that's true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um
Customer 239.332625 247.032250 [silence]
Customer 247.032250 251.178250 well you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so much [laughter]
Agent 247.210375 250.983625 [silence]
Agent 250.983625 252.331125 medical care

Customer 254.562375 256.369625 [laughter]
Agent 255.579750 260.060125 you'd have you'd you'd have your office visits covered but that's only a small part of the total
Customer 256.369625 258.689250 [silence]
Customer 258.689250 260.830500 yeah i'm sure but
Agent 260.060125 261.408875 yeah
Customer 260.830500 266.894750 uh on the other hand you know maybe maybe if you had false teeth you wouldn't care about dental insurance
Agent 261.408875 266.648250 [silence]
Agent 266.648250 279.543375 uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldn't you now i don't care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to
Customer 266.894750 269.516875 [silence]
Customer 269.516875 270.339250 would you
Customer 270.339250 271.427875 i don't know
Customer 271.427875 286.631250 [silence]
Agent 279.543375 286.578875 uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly
Agent 286.578875 295.777875 uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation
Customer 286.631250 287.631750 yeah
Customer 287.631750 295.417000 [silence]
