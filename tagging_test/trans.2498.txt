Customer 0.588875 3.198000 you can go ahead and start if you want uh
Agent 3.183000 12.174125 well um the budget's an interesting issue uh particularly since i'm pretty much a libertarian and an {anachro} libertarian at that
Customer 3.198000 29.319500 [silence]
Agent 12.174125 24.251125 uh so i would basically say the way to fix the budget is to uh cut and eliminate taxes charge user fees for things that uh are absolutely necessary and to be allocated fairly that way
Agent 24.251125 28.513875 and um i'd say ninety percent of the budget has no business being there
Agent 28.513875 39.390750 [silence]
Customer 29.319500 40.543500 [noise] i can agree with that and uh i know one thing we we need to do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because that's what's really [noise] hurting everybody's goat [noise]
Agent 39.390750 40.743375 uh-huh
Customer 40.543500 42.837125 uh
Agent 40.743375 46.520000 yeah i th[ink]- i think a lot of people fail to realize but you know the government doesn't generate money
Customer 42.837125 54.706625 [silence]
Agent 46.520000 54.687250 you know they may print it but that's not really the way money is made it's it's made from people working and doing things that are productive and government's the net cost
Agent 54.687250 56.886875 [silence]
Customer 54.706625 57.488500 and government doesn't produce anything
Agent 56.886875 58.477000 that's right
Customer 57.488500 67.999500 [silence]
Agent 58.477000 62.277500 so uh a dollar tax isn't isn't a dollar that can be
Agent 62.277500 67.730625 you know that that makes more bread or anything else it's uh it's lost
Agent 67.730625 76.557500 [silence]
Customer 67.999500 81.569250 correct that uh i guess the uh the big thing about that is the fact that they're spending someone else's money it's not like it's they're out of their own savings account
Agent 76.557500 78.020000 uh-huh
Agent 78.020000 81.139625 [silence]

Customer 122.077250 130.668875 i i guess the uh the latest uh fire they came under was whenever they were providing a
Customer 130.668875 135.759875 uh a tribute to um Lawrence Welk
Agent 135.185750 137.684000 hum oh that's right

Customer 138.755250 149.706250 restoration to his home i think that was called back because of all the flack they received but but that's the another one of the big examples of
Agent 139.286125 152.700750 [silence]
Customer 149.706250 154.092625 why we're in such dilemma

Agent 161.045625 163.664750 the art's in humanity should be privately funded
Customer 161.994000 163.000125 [silence]
Customer 163.000125 164.504500 i agree
Agent 163.664750 174.084500 um a lot of these social welfare programs i mean that's why they're things like United Way is when you and i think that those are important but we give our dollars to them and it shouldn't be a government responsibility
Customer 164.504500 173.609250 [silence]
Customer 173.609250 174.993375 uh-huh
Agent 174.084500 179.985250 but the government i think is supposed to be doing is is defending our rights
