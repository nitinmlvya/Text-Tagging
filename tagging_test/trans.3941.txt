Agent 241.683875 262.931750 [silence]
Customer 241.880375 251.982000 that's true and uh it seems like it goes up every year you have no control over the the cost to you and that just takes away your buying power also and uh
Customer 251.982000 261.358000 the company of course i can see the company's side uh too because uh they have to pay uh an a proportion of whatever the
Customer 261.358000 268.466750 the health cost is and it gets to the point where uh they're not uh making money and uh
Agent 262.931750 264.242500 yeah
