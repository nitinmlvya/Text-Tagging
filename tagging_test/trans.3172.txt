Agent 0.527750 104.415750 [silence]
Customer 1.846750 12.818000 oh on a number of people's minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didn't spend money here and there i hear them_1 talk about uh cutting
Customer 12.818000 20.867375 what they call aid to some foreign countries and people don't understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and
Customer 20.867375 30.549750 and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh y[ou]- start giving a country uh

Customer 49.427875 58.599625 and the government's been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and i'm not sure if the general public uh
Customer 58.599625 70.679000 thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little
Customer 70.679000 74.849375 far fetched and not necessarily for the common good
Customer 74.849375 79.520250 uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few

Agent 188.024000 193.379625 but unless they start working on it um
Agent 193.379625 198.435125 it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable

Agent 202.574750 204.849125 uh steps
Agent 204.849125 212.631125 uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um
Agent 212.631125 225.532250 i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits
Agent 225.532250 234.577000 the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the
Agent 234.577000 241.658875 federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think that's our future if we
Agent 241.658875 248.725750 um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um
Agent 248.725750 253.886250 some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um
