Agent 8.784125 14.717875 um i try to project out um right now i project out six months
Customer 9.520500 14.087500 [silence]

Customer 15.515375 16.614875 [silence]
Customer 16.614875 17.869625 [noise]
Customer 17.869625 19.917750 right [noise] uh-huh
Agent 19.774500 24.979375 and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to
Customer 19.917750 26.107125 [silence]
Agent 24.979375 26.767125 take off the top
Customer 26.107125 27.735625 oh
Agent 26.767125 33.133250 not unless i have something come up that's unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings
Customer 27.735625 29.157125 [silence]
Customer 29.157125 30.316875 uh-huh
Customer 30.316875 32.246500 [silence]
Customer 32.246500 33.745500 oh
Agent 33.133250 34.719250 and
Customer 33.745500 36.368000 well that seems to work out pretty good
Agent 34.719250 35.961250 [silence]
Agent 35.961250 41.054250 kind of the formula i use i use uh ninety percent of my check
Customer 36.368000 40.342375 [silence]
Customer 40.342375 42.072250 oh
Agent 41.054250 46.656000 and then i retain ten percent and if i don't use it then it goes into savings also
Customer 42.072250 43.128500 [silence]
Customer 43.128500 44.937375 for savings
Customer 44.937375 45.985250 [silence]
Customer 45.985250 53.106375 oh is i[t]- is it hard to set it up for the six month period rather than just a month or
Agent 46.656000 51.311750 [silence]
Agent 51.311750 61.877750 well my monthly bills are pretty consistent you know you have your house payments the same every month uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due
Customer 53.106375 55.090000 oh
Customer 55.090000 56.453875 [silence]
Customer 56.453875 57.890875 right
Customer 57.890875 59.712125 [silence]
Customer 59.712125 61.311500 uh-huh
Customer 61.311500 63.447250 so in fact
Agent 61.877750 70.347125 so you budget all that in that's why a lot of times i only use ninety percent of my salary because some months i'll have insurance
Customer 63.447250 64.763250 it might
Customer 64.763250 69.323375 [silence]
Customer 69.323375 70.720375 uh-huh
Agent 70.347125 72.068500 um
Customer 70.720375 73.376250 [silence]
Agent 72.068500 74.002000 two or three times a year
Customer 73.376250 74.847000 right
Agent 74.002000 78.669375 and i need that extra money and to take it out of savings at that point
Customer 74.847000 78.143500 [silence]
Customer 78.143500 87.669500 oh so really when you're doing it it probably is just as easy to do it for the six month period rather than just a month at a time oh
Agent 78.669375 82.788250 [silence]
Agent 82.788250 83.616500 sure
Agent 83.616500 85.060625 [silence]
Agent 85.060625 100.344750 um-hum a month at a time is not a really a big picture of what's going on in your life because it doesn't give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the road that you know is coming down the road that you need to save for
Customer 87.669500 89.064875 [silence]
Customer 89.064875 90.586375 no
Customer 90.586375 95.294500 [silence]
Customer 95.294500 96.687500 uh-huh
Customer 96.687500 99.729625 [silence]
Customer 99.729625 109.062625 oh right and then also i mean that's if you do it monthly that's twelve times you have to sit down and figure it out and you could save all that
Agent 100.344750 106.807000 [silence]
Agent 106.807000 113.123000 yeah i do it uh twice a year and um you know i could adjust it every month that's no big deal
Customer 109.062625 111.336250 [silence]
Customer 111.336250 113.680125 uh-huh uh-huh
Agent 113.123000 121.504375 but uh i just finished out December and uh when i was done with it i threw it away and i already had January through July made out
Customer 113.680125 116.264250 [silence]
Customer 116.264250 117.563125 um-hum
Customer 117.563125 121.041375 [silence]
Customer 121.041375 130.989000 so you do it January to July and then July to December oh oh does now how did you say you worked your savings do you take your savings right off
Agent 121.504375 123.564500 [silence]
Agent 123.564500 125.524000 um-hum yeah
Agent 125.524000 129.829750 [silence]

Customer 132.708125 134.100500 uh-huh
Agent 133.557500 137.240250 i'm the type of individual that uh you know i can't
Customer 134.100500 138.804750 [silence]
Agent 137.240250 141.521125 i have to put something back for myself to feel like i'm doing my job
Customer 138.804750 140.390875 uh-huh
Customer 140.390875 142.644750 right right
Agent 141.521125 143.117500 it's my motivator
Customer 142.644750 146.261250 and how much at what percentage do you save
Agent 143.117500 145.066625 [silence]
Agent 145.066625 147.812875 i save about fifteen percent
Customer 146.261250 148.651125 oh that's great

Customer 148.651125 151.080375 [silence]
Customer 151.080375 159.285875 [laughter] well that that's fairly good do you get paid once a month or by twice a month
Agent 151.994000 156.912750 [silence]
Agent 156.912750 162.048625 twice a month uh uh actually every other week so twenty six checks

Customer 165.187125 167.180125 [silence]
Customer 167.180125 171.296625 oh that's right so that helps out
Agent 167.447500 170.520625 [silence]
Agent 170.520625 172.080125 uh-huh
Customer 171.296625 173.573875 gives you a bit there oh
