Agent 3.213875 7.905125 oh well i think it needs some drastic uh
Customer 3.776000 9.609625 [silence]
Agent 7.905125 11.256000 drastic help [laughter] um
Customer 9.609625 10.819125 oh yeah
Customer 10.819125 33.515125 [silence]
Agent 11.256000 16.510125 i- i think there's a lot of waste that that could uh that could be cut out
Agent 16.510125 21.310125 if we could get uh politicians to be less less of politicians
Agent 21.310125 22.657625 um
Agent 22.657625 24.077375 and um
Agent 24.077375 33.865875 i- i think it needs to be given a really high priority because_1 i- i think it has a horrible effect on the economy and and what we can do as a country and everything else
Customer 33.515125 38.377125 i know that we're affected uh directly uh at TI because of uh
Agent 33.865875 39.132625 [silence]
Customer 38.377125 49.170000 the defense budget cuts but i certainly think that's one of the the things that they're doing already which is uh wh[ich]- which was [vocalized-noise] needed to be done for probably the last few years uh
Agent 39.132625 40.491625 sure
Agent 40.491625 43.043000 [silence]
Agent 43.043000 44.404375 right
Agent 44.404375 48.145625 [silence]
Agent 48.145625 49.459625 yeah
Customer 49.170000 54.150750 although with the Russian situation and all the world situation changing the way it is uh
Agent 49.459625 67.300125 [silence]
Customer 54.150750 63.281875 it certainly needed i the obvious one that people all talk about that i still don't understand is uh i'm at work let me turn my radio off here
Customer 63.281875 65.707500 uh is uh
Customer 65.707500 71.128000 all the foreign aid i you know it's over it's a fifty years roughly since World War II
Agent 67.300125 68.450375 yeah
Agent 68.450375 70.476875 [silence]
Agent 70.476875 71.513625 yeah
Customer 71.128000 77.571375 i don't understand why we're i understand that we support Israel and all the other countries but why do we have to give them cash
Agent 71.513625 82.509625 [silence]
Customer 77.571375 79.672500 rather than just selling them
Customer 79.672500 86.255625 military things at a discount or something i don't get the id[ea]- the idea of giving people three billion dollars a year
Agent 82.509625 83.860625 yeah
Agent 83.860625 85.510000 [silence]
Agent 85.510000 89.502375 right i- i have a hard time with that too now i can understand
Customer 86.255625 97.539375 [silence]
Agent 89.502375 92.070875 uh for instance the uh
Agent 92.070875 97.948625 situation in say the Philippines where they needed some cash to jump start their economy
Customer 97.539375 98.622750 yeah
Agent 97.948625 106.236750 but i don't see where we i mean i think it's crazy to be just pouring money into an economy that's obviously mismanaged for instance um
Customer 98.622750 103.976000 [silence]
Customer 103.976000 105.327625 right
Customer 105.327625 108.684500 well i think that we should give humanitarian aid and that's it
Agent 106.236750 107.472000 [silence]
Agent 107.472000 108.826125 right
Customer 108.684500 112.826500 you know i think we can loan food or or relief relief aid or whatever you want to call it but i
Agent 108.826125 109.984250 yeah
Agent 109.984250 111.464875 [silence]
Agent 111.464875 112.489500 right
Agent 112.489500 117.425250 [silence]
Customer 112.826500 113.835625 [silence]
Customer 113.835625 117.678625 not cash money i think you can send them wheat in other [noise] words i think that helps our farmers but
Agent 117.425250 118.490000 right
Customer 117.678625 119.555375 to send them money i don't i don't
Agent 118.490000 119.770750 yeah
Customer 119.555375 121.824000 see under any circumstances where you send anybody money
Agent 119.770750 121.369875 [silence]
Agent 121.369875 125.507375 i'm not sure i understand the i- i guess there's a
Customer 121.824000 137.950125 [silence]
Agent 125.507375 132.622625 a a reason for [laughter-that] and i- i just don't know enough about it to understand the sense of it because
Agent 132.622625 138.097125 it's not an obvious i- i mean on the surface there's no obvious reason why we should be doing that
Customer 137.950125 139.260375 right
Agent 138.097125 139.771375 i have to agree with you there
Customer 139.260375 143.969625 i'm amazed that n[either]- neither party or or the which i guess they're independent parties too
Agent 139.771375 148.989250 [silence]
Customer 143.969625 149.931125 why they don't talk about it i mean they don't bring it up at all why you would think they'd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other
Agent 148.989250 151.233000 right yeah
Customer 149.931125 152.528000 and they never talk about it they just keep doing it you know
Agent 151.233000 156.036375 yeah that there's some kind of justification there and i don't know what it is
Customer 152.528000 157.989000 [silence]
Agent 156.036375 160.313250 and i don't know if i agree with it or [laughter-not] yeah
Customer 157.989000 162.834375 i- i just like to hear them talk about it you know i like to hear some of the congressmen or senators at least
Agent 160.313250 161.762625 [silence]
Agent 161.762625 162.867750 right
Customer 162.834375 167.815750 say well let's let's bring this before let's examine every one of our foreign aids
Agent 162.867750 167.140000 [silence]
Agent 167.140000 168.492375 right
Customer 167.815750 176.645250 and look like like they did with the defense with the military bases they they investigated all those rightfully wrongly wrongfully whether which ones should be closed i don't know but
Agent 168.492375 175.352375 [silence]
Agent 175.352375 176.852375 right
Customer 176.645250 182.000375 at least they looked at it i think they should look at foreign aid and say hey which ones do we not need to give you know
Agent 176.852375 180.674250 [silence]
Agent 180.674250 188.372625 right well you know the the the other thing is that you have all th[is]- this all this partisan politics
Customer 182.000375 204.669000 [silence]
Agent 188.372625 193.082500 where you have a person who's representing a particular state
Agent 193.082500 197.520000 and he says well m[y]- my state it would advantageous
Agent 197.520000 209.070125 if the [vocalized-noise] if the United States spent money to uh you know to investigate uh potato blithe or something you know and that's and there is tons of that and
Customer 204.669000 206.073000 right yeah
Customer 206.073000 208.219500 [silence]
Customer 208.219500 209.630125 i know that is amazing
Agent 209.070125 214.502500 and that is just a horrible waste of money i think and it's and it's done because some
Customer 209.630125 219.996000 [silence]
Agent 214.502500 221.036250 constituent [vocalized-noise] you know i [vocalized-noise] well it's done because they want to impress the the people that are going to vote for him next month
Customer 219.996000 221.422875 um-hum
Agent 221.036250 233.851500 and uh if if there was a way to get around that and i think i think some of that could be avoided if we put uh uh a finite term on on some of these peoples um
Customer 221.422875 233.968000 [silence]
Agent 233.851500 238.986000 uh [vocalized-noise] uh you know stay in office um
Customer 233.968000 236.260375 oh i agree with you there
Customer 236.260375 261.924125 [silence]
Agent 238.986000 243.335875 i- i think they would h[ave]- they wouldn't have time to i mean they'd have to
Agent 243.335875 246.296875 i think their incentive would be to go out
Agent 246.296875 255.494625 uh or and making their mark on history and they [laughter-wouldn't] [laughter-even] [laughter-be] [laughter-wasting] their time on little {piddly} stuff that's just draining draining money
Agent 255.494625 262.494250 uh instead they'd concentrate on doing something that was significant um i would hope so anyway
Customer 261.924125 265.673750 yeah i saw one about a month or so ago on Twenty Twenty i think it was
Agent 262.494250 269.332875 [silence]
Customer 265.673750 270.164375 where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but
Agent 269.332875 270.479000 yeah
Customer 270.164375 271.711500 he wanted to start
Agent 270.479000 277.118500 [silence]
Customer 271.711500 275.541250 another drug headquarters in his state
Customer 275.541250 278.247500 and no one was asking for it but him
Agent 277.118500 279.933250 [laughter]
Customer 278.247500 282.431375 and he got the money appro[ved]- got it approved by tagging it on to some other bill
Agent 279.933250 281.481750 yeah
Agent 281.481750 289.133375 [silence]
Customer 282.431375 287.623250 and it di[dn't]- you know the the newsman asked him wh[at]- wh[at]- no one is asking for this why do you you know
Customer 287.623250 292.880125 and it was just totally a boondoggle i mean it was just uh him wanting to build something that nobody wanted
Agent 289.133375 291.011625 yeah sure
Agent 291.011625 292.439625 [silence]
Agent 292.439625 297.271875 right well that's that's you know that's the catch word these days is drug you know drug fight drug
Customer 292.880125 294.212000 [silence]
Customer 294.212000 295.625375 right
Customer 295.625375 296.522750 [silence]
Customer 296.522750 298.212875 right
Agent 297.271875 299.934125 [vocalized-noise] i mean he got himself
Customer 298.212875 298.889000 [silence]
Customer 298.889000 303.611000 but the drug agency wasn't asking for it he was asking for it you know which didn't make any sense at all
Agent 299.934125 302.667750 [laughter]
Agent 302.667750 306.609000 yeah [noise] i don't know [vocalized-noise] he it looked can look good on his re[sume]- resume
Customer 303.611000 306.247125 [silence]
Customer 306.247125 307.630250 right
Agent 306.609000 308.507000 [laughter]
Customer 307.630250 313.500500 it is amazing how the the congressmen and senators just start are totally in another world once they get elected
Agent 308.507000 311.770125 [silence]
Agent 311.770125 313.065250 yeah
Agent 313.065250 316.243250 yeah oh yeah and well you know it's like
Customer 313.500500 327.730625 [silence]
Agent 316.243250 328.100000 i've i've really gotten cynical i guess as i've gotten older but i've i've been watching you know the the campaigns and stuff and it's it just it's just amazing how little anybody really says
Customer 327.730625 331.412250 right or well duh i thought you were going to say what they do
Agent 328.100000 329.773500 [silence]
Agent 329.773500 332.480750 [laughter-oh] that too [laughter]
Customer 331.412250 334.768625 i i've been trying to go over in my own mind when they say
Agent 332.480750 338.178000 [silence]
Customer 334.768625 344.571750 we're gonna really if you vote for me we're gonna control crime and drugs and then they don't do anything nothing they don't have they had any president or [laughter-anybody] every done anything against crime and [laughter-drugs] you know
Agent 338.178000 340.120000 right right
Agent 340.120000 340.679250 w[ell]-
Agent 340.679250 341.853000 [silence]
Agent 341.853000 343.063875 no
Agent 343.063875 348.435000 no i mean and because it's you know [vocalized-noise] and it's because nothing is black and white
Customer 344.571750 347.939750 [silence]
Customer 347.939750 348.973000 right
Agent 348.435000 353.175625 you know you just can't go up and go up there and say well we're going to we're going to stop crime now
Customer 348.973000 352.621875 [silence]
Customer 352.621875 354.973500 right yeah exactly
Agent 353.175625 356.447500 if it were that simple somebody would have [laughter-done] [laughter-it] a long time ago
Customer 354.973500 356.986375 right exactly
Agent 356.447500 365.370125 and that's what ki[nd]- you know they there's the people that says well we'll we'll never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or you know it's like the guy who says you're never going to raise taxes
Customer 356.986375 367.927625 [silence]
Agent 365.370125 371.499625 doesn't isn't realistic about what he see you know what he's doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes
Customer 367.927625 368.991500 right
Customer 368.991500 390.998750 [silence]
Agent 371.499625 384.514500 will raise them but but it will all it the money will not help anything that's what kills me um [noise] you know the for instance here here in Texas they're talking about uh an income tax
Agent 384.514500 391.235250 well i could almost support an income tax if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax
Customer 390.998750 393.191250 right yeah you can't double up yeah
Agent 391.235250 401.042625 but nobody's talking about [laughter-that] [laughter-they] want both you know [laughter] no i know and they never go away they just get higher and there's more of them you know
Customer 393.191250 394.661875 exactly
Customer 394.661875 396.705625 exactly they never go away
Customer 396.705625 399.641125 [silence]
Customer 399.641125 400.534375 th[e]-
Customer 400.534375 403.791000 the funniest thing i heard lately about politicians uh joke was uh
Agent 401.042625 406.019500 [silence]
Customer 403.791000 406.694000 uh do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying
Agent 406.019500 411.325250 [laughter]
Customer 406.694000 407.959250 [silence]
Customer 407.959250 409.363750 his lips are moving
Customer 409.363750 411.965250 [laughter]
Agent 411.325250 422.160125 yeah my favorite yeah yeah yeah yeah my favorite one about politicians is that a politician's a person who's made it to the top because he didn't have what it takes to make it at the bottom
Customer 411.965250 416.008125 th[at]- that that that see that covers is all you know [laughter]
Customer 416.008125 421.278375 [silence]
Customer 421.278375 429.343250 right yeah but it it is the the budget thing is just and i don't know why they don't talk about it logically it's always always uh
Agent 422.160125 423.318250 yeah
Agent 423.318250 433.833125 [silence]
Customer 429.343250 436.036875 again the only thing i guess they're doing logically now is the defense which is certainly hurting TI to a degree although we've done so well with the
Agent 433.833125 435.074625 yeah
Agent 435.074625 439.167375 [silence]
Customer 436.036875 438.955500 Gulf War we got a lot of good positive press
Customer 438.955500 443.975250 with all the exotic uh weapon systems and i think we'll get a lot of those you know but uh
Agent 439.167375 440.550625 right
Agent 440.550625 442.646875 [silence]
Agent 442.646875 443.535875 yeah
Agent 443.535875 448.993875 [silence]
Customer 443.975250 450.209500 uh you you need to close so many bases and you need to cut out some missiles or i mean some uh programs and all
Agent 448.993875 450.111500 right
Agent 450.111500 451.480500 [silence]
Customer 450.209500 455.064000 uh and they're doing that i think that's that's really good even though it it hurts a lot bit you know
Agent 451.480500 452.721250 well
Agent 452.721250 453.689125 [silence]
Agent 453.689125 458.390875 yeah the the problem is that the budget is so complicated
Customer 455.064000 460.416500 [silence]
Agent 458.390875 463.894000 and what they're doing are the things that are easy they're making the easy choices
Customer 460.416500 461.551875 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 461.551875 462.687250 [silence]
Customer 462.687250 464.644875 well then that's probably true
Agent 463.894000 466.809750 and and uh um
Customer 464.644875 480.160500 [silence]
Agent 466.809750 473.275000 and it's and i think part of it is that the budget you know the the economy and the budget is too complicated
Agent 473.275000 478.223125 for a lot of the politicians i mean they can't comprehend um
Agent 478.223125 485.025750 you know what it takes what it needs they just don't have the expertise the other thing is they can't it's too
Customer 480.160500 481.404375 um-hum
Customer 481.404375 492.002250 [silence]
Agent 485.025750 487.061625 uh it's not in their
Agent 487.061625 492.854250 political career interest to make some of the hard decisions that are going to need to be made
Customer 492.002250 493.300000 right
Agent 492.854250 502.212750 uh and so what you do is you do the obvious things you know and and they they don't really help all that much i mean sure they help some and i'm s[ure]-
Customer 493.300000 495.542000 [silence]
Customer 495.542000 496.560000 right
Customer 496.560000 501.038125 [silence]
Customer 501.038125 502.125500 i do[n't]-
Customer 502.125500 508.428375 go ahead i was going to say i know you mentioned it but i don't know why we can't change the laws where the[re]- the congress and the
Agent 502.212750 509.664875 [silence]
Customer 508.428375 512.236375 senators just have eight years or or terms because the president has it
Agent 509.664875 511.090375 right
Agent 511.090375 515.240500 [silence]
Customer 512.236375 515.955875 and i think that uh is you know you don't want someone in there forever
Agent 515.240500 516.581875 right
Customer 515.955875 519.582875 and the congressmen go in there forever and th[at's]- that's their whole life then
