Agent 35.793500 42.226000 i think we're paying i i i used to live in Sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do
Customer 38.866250 40.135250 um-hum
Customer 40.135250 41.378875 [silence]
Customer 41.378875 45.686625 yeah it's even higher uh tax rate over there on income
Agent 42.226000 44.205250 [silence]
Agent 44.205250 48.117375 yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is
Customer 45.686625 47.209125 [silence]
Customer 47.209125 51.827500 right a[re]- are you you're a na[tive]- you're from uh the United States

Customer 51.827500 53.668750 [silence]
Customer 53.668750 56.626125 but you worked over there for a couple of year
Agent 54.828500 62.092625 yeah yeah i wa[s]- so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an im[pression]- kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic
Customer 56.626125 61.310000 [silence]
Customer 61.310000 62.666500 yes
Agent 62.092625 69.700125 and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much
Customer 62.666500 69.048000 [silence]
Customer 69.048000 70.457750 [laughter]
Agent 69.700125 77.497000 i uh i do get concerned that there's that there's a lot of uh government spending on things like um
Customer 70.457750 88.826750 [silence]
Agent 77.497000 79.119625 [silence]
Agent 79.119625 89.593750 things that that don't really benefit anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that
Customer 88.826750 94.891000 right you talking about special projects in the U[S]- in the US you mean now
Agent 89.593750 91.480750 it
Agent 91.480750 92.941000 [silence]
Agent 92.941000 94.074125 [noise]
Agent 94.074125 95.845125 right
Customer 94.891000 107.123250 okay yeah it's true i feel that um you know i don't feel that uh we're paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think we've kind of gotten away from that
Agent 95.845125 110.849875 [silence]
Customer 107.123250 111.728375 um for what we get we're paying too much i would say
Agent 110.849875 114.987000 you wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it
Customer 111.728375 114.049000 [silence]
Customer 114.049000 118.886500 right or if if things i didn't feel that things were wasted
Agent 114.987000 118.879875 [silence]
Agent 118.879875 120.396625 i can go
Customer 118.886500 129.837750 for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh mon[ey]- a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste
Agent 120.396625 130.206875 [silence]
Customer 129.837750 143.171625 [silence]
Agent 130.206875 138.152000 yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because i'm single i'm in a reasonably high tax bracket
Agent 138.152000 139.474750 so
Agent 139.474750 143.811625 um it seems very expensive to me for what i get
Customer 143.171625 146.323375 right right typically um
Agent 143.811625 148.343625 [silence]
Customer 146.323375 148.768625 you don't get a whole lot [laughter]
Agent 148.343625 161.595250 no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on
Customer 148.768625 171.092750 [silence]
Agent 161.595250 164.710250 and uh welfare on
Agent 164.710250 168.336875 reasonable amounts of welfare i don't mind spending money on
Agent 168.336875 171.873625 and things like highways and stuff i don't mind spending on
Customer 171.092750 182.079875 well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents Patrick Buchanan has a idea that says that
Agent 171.873625 199.589000 [silence]
Customer 182.079875 188.229375 if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare
Customer 188.229375 194.782625 so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system
Customer 194.782625 199.059000 you know you you have you get to spend your time but then you're off
Customer 199.059000 215.132625 [silence]
Agent 199.589000 201.009000 huh
Agent 201.009000 203.996750 don't know if i agree with that or not
Agent 203.996750 213.106500 i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason
Agent 213.106500 216.324750 although two years that does sound like quite a while
Customer 215.132625 216.593125 yes
Agent 216.324750 218.756625 i don't know what do you think of that one
Customer 216.593125 219.331500 [silence]
Agent 218.756625 229.360125 [silence]
Customer 219.331500 229.736250 well i- i- i guess i'm not i don't like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because_1 there's always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure
Agent 229.360125 232.419000 he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue
Customer 229.736250 231.253750 uh-huh
Customer 231.253750 232.877750 yeah
Agent 232.419000 243.623250 um one thing that i've kind of been following that i i'd really i'm kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it and that is for President Bush to uh see if he can
Customer 232.877750 246.909000 [silence]
Agent 243.623250 247.540500 see if he can uh give the line item veto a try
Customer 246.909000 248.185500 right
Agent 247.540500 252.108375 and uh apparently he's been waiting for a test case he's been waiting for quite a while
Customer 248.185500 251.404875 [silence]
Customer 251.404875 252.603500 hm
Agent 252.108375 261.231125 but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that
Customer 252.603500 257.742250 [silence]
Customer 257.742250 259.174125 yes
Customer 259.174125 261.286875 [silence]
Agent 261.231125 263.645000 that'd be quite an exciting battle
Customer 261.286875 262.652625 yeah
Customer 262.652625 264.082000 um-hum
Agent 263.645000 269.765125 [silence]
Customer 264.082000 270.504625 yeah i don't know what's your situation i live uh i'm a property owner in the city limits of Atlanta
Agent 269.765125 271.102250 uh-huh
Customer 270.504625 281.726125 and we get taxed t[remendously]- tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesn't go for what the original intent of property taxes was
Agent 271.102250 291.313250 [silence]
Customer 281.726125 288.383625 um i pay for a a local hospital uh Grady Hospital where a lot of
Customer 288.383625 291.907375 indigent people are go and get free care
Agent 291.313250 292.627625 uh-huh
Customer 291.907375 300.482000 and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i- i and a lot of other thing[s]-
Agent 292.627625 300.482000 [silence]
