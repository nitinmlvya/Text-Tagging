Customer 68.932625 78.614875 and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess
Customer 78.614875 87.983250 what i feel is that most people um they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like well there's some people who aren't paying their fair share
Agent 85.996000 96.913750 yeah i thi[nk]- yeah it's the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to [laughter] [noise]

Agent 175.468875 189.657625 and that it's mostly sales tax so it's really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff i've lived in Texas most of my life we um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and

Agent 208.424250 216.279500 a state income tax was also kind of tough too um i guess since we've been married we've moved a lot and so it always seems like

Customer 282.171125 296.809625 this'll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think we're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way we're compensated
Agent 292.462250 294.259875 yeah
Agent 294.259875 317.454250 [silence]
