Agent 34.071625 47.412250 um does not have a state income tax and so we don't have a state income tax but we certainly make up for it in other ways here um for instance the local um sales tax is eight and a quarter percent
Customer 36.583500 37.963875 right
Customer 37.963875 46.571500 [silence]

Customer 55.941000 76.805750 [silence]
Agent 62.274625 77.213750 it's starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded and and i don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not i think eventually they're going to have to do it
Customer 76.805750 78.205500 uh-huh
Agent 77.213750 81.899625 but um do you think you pay too much there or how do you feel about that

Agent 104.849000 107.820000 [silence]
Agent 107.820000 109.177375 uh-huh
Customer 108.846000 118.651875 and i know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in New York or out of state and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that
Agent 109.177375 118.039125 [silence]
Agent 118.039125 126.267375 how interesting i guess i didn't realize that um we don't have tax on groceries for instance um
Customer 118.651875 120.752125 [silence]
Customer 120.752125 122.267500 uh-huh
Customer 122.267500 124.368750 [silence]
Customer 124.368750 133.985625 no well we don't have it necessarily on food but then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know
Agent 126.267375 130.068375 [silence]
Agent 130.068375 131.197750 yeah

Customer 133.985625 140.020750 [silence]
Customer 140.020750 141.681875 yeah
Agent 141.224625 155.984875 yeah and you really have to watch your your um your bill sometimes i think um it's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries [laughter] and that's when it really starts to add on and um
Customer 141.681875 151.924875 [silence]
Customer 151.924875 153.544875 [laughter]
Customer 153.544875 165.377500 [silence]
Agent 155.984875 167.042125 so um that's that is sort of a help but um i don't know it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of of tax on uh any sale as far as i'm concerned um
Customer 165.377500 167.597750 yeah that would uh
Agent 167.042125 176.310500 it's real interesting this last um tax season i'm a student and the last tax season i had a just a part time job helping out in a tax office
Customer 167.597750 189.367500 [silence]
Agent 176.310500 190.847875 and the woman that owned the office was saying she'd had this business for oh probably seventeen or eighteen years and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can uh take off of their income tax
Customer 189.367500 191.392250 deduct yeah
Agent 190.847875 200.256000 and uh you know if you're not a home owner it's or if you haven't sold property or uh have something major like that it's hardly you know it it's just not much else you can do
Customer 191.392250 198.140875 [silence]
Customer 198.140875 199.534375 uh-huh
Customer 199.534375 206.210125 [silence]
Agent 200.256000 211.535875 and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts can't do oh really
Customer 206.210125 207.533250 uh-huh
Customer 207.533250 210.470000 and see i take it she was an accountant
Customer 210.470000 211.875125 yeah
Agent 211.535875 214.704500 can't do it any more [laughter] so
Customer 211.875125 212.970000 [silence]
Customer 212.970000 226.411250 yeah uh-huh i know well i- i- i also was a student i just graduated in May and um i graduated with a finance degree but that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax
Agent 214.704500 218.122250 [silence]
Agent 218.122250 219.337750 uh-huh
Agent 219.337750 225.415250 [silence]
Agent 225.415250 230.035375 [laughter] how interesting
Customer 226.411250 228.607750 [laughter]
Customer 228.607750 230.645750 that was the big joke [laughter]
Agent 230.035375 232.715000 oh gosh where did you go to school
Customer 230.645750 231.695000 [silence]
Customer 231.695000 233.437125 Clarion University
Agent 232.715000 241.499500 uh-huh uh-huh well you're you're the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too i'm a graduate student having gone back after many years so um
Customer 233.437125 239.669625 [silence]
Customer 239.669625 241.016125 [laughter-oh]
Customer 241.016125 242.887500 [silence]
Agent 241.499500 244.700750 nevertheless i am a student and poor [laughter]
Customer 242.887500 244.293000 [laughter-yeah]
Customer 244.293000 245.519250 uh-huh
Agent 244.700750 247.083000 so it's uh um
Customer 245.519250 257.002125 [silence]
Agent 247.083000 260.450500 you know it's been i- i guess as far as people like uh our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with Americans with um college age students you know and
Customer 257.002125 258.463250 um-hum
Customer 258.463250 259.952625 yeah
Customer 259.952625 266.195500 [silence]
Agent 260.450500 267.374375 and i there just i don't know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and
Customer 266.195500 274.085750 uh-huh i think they should go back i- i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets
Agent 267.374375 281.939375 [silence]
Customer 274.085750 282.326375 but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy
Agent 281.939375 288.810875 oh yes absolutely yeah because_1 uh it seems like y[ou]- they still come out okay um you know uh they
Customer 282.326375 286.643000 [silence]
Customer 286.643000 294.407250 yeah yeah you know they always have the argument well you know well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know well
Agent 288.810875 292.977500 [silence]
Agent 292.977500 293.834250 yeah
Agent 293.834250 295.161875 [silence]
Customer 294.407250 295.661625 [laughter]
Agent 295.161875 299.376750 i kind of have my doubts [laughter]
Customer 295.661625 308.885000 i don't care how much they take off of you you know you're still going to be above on top and i you know like you said i i've worked in different places and the ones that get the most pay do the least work
Agent 299.376750 300.282125 uh-huh
Agent 300.282125 302.199875 [silence]
Agent 302.199875 303.107875 that's
Agent 303.107875 308.571875 [silence]
Agent 308.571875 323.424500 yes seems that way yeah that the higher they get the you know at least i don't know it seems like um they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or um [vocalized-noise] or or something or just the title sometimes um
Customer 308.885000 322.188875 [silence]
Customer 322.188875 323.613500 uh-huh
Agent 323.424500 332.395000 and it it doesn't seem fair and i- i know a lot of people do make money um you know in in good investments and things like that
Customer 323.613500 336.110375 [silence]
Agent 332.395000 338.609250 but i think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a wh[ole]- not a whole lot of work [laughter]
Customer 336.110375 343.149125 [laughter] i agree with you i do think it's a lot of luck and i don't like that part of the finance you know whatsoever
Agent 338.609250 341.221250 [silence]
Agent 341.221250 342.650375 yes
Agent 342.650375 343.941375 right
Customer 343.149125 351.434500 i don't know but like what i was saying about the social security that's real you know it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes
Agent 343.941375 351.414875 [silence]
Agent 351.414875 352.431500 uh-huh
Customer 351.434500 363.784375 and then the more i think about it the more i think i'm paying in to something that i granted you know i'm paying for my grandparents but i'm never going to see that social security is going to be gone before i ever get any
Agent 352.431500 358.014500 [silence]
Agent 358.014500 358.802500 right
Agent 358.802500 359.899500 [silence]
Agent 359.899500 361.313625 probably not
Agent 361.313625 363.121250 [silence]
Agent 363.121250 370.343500 yeah yes or what's left is not going to be worth anything um you know in terms of how you can actually use it
Customer 363.784375 366.624125 [silence]
Customer 366.624125 367.850000 um-hum
Customer 367.850000 368.909125 [silence]
Customer 368.909125 371.824625 right they're going to pay me fifty dollars a month [laughter-well]
Agent 370.343500 371.716875 [silence]
Agent 371.716875 374.363250 yeah right but that's well and
Customer 371.824625 373.061500 [laughter]
Customer 373.061500 376.165250 i'm sorry i put in much more than that you know
Agent 374.363250 375.557875 [silence]
Agent 375.557875 387.686125 that's right yeah yeah that's i haven't heard much um in recent years um about social security i mean for a while there not too long ago they were they were saying that the the whole system was going to be um bankrupt
Customer 376.165250 387.536500 [silence]
Customer 387.536500 388.899750 uh-huh
Agent 387.686125 396.945375 you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it wa[s]- that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just weren't in existence and um
Customer 388.899750 392.735750 [silence]
Customer 392.735750 394.302875 right
Customer 394.302875 395.826000 uh-huh
Customer 395.826000 403.287375 [silence]
Agent 396.945375 404.551875 then i it sort of calmed down i haven't heard much lately but if you have talked about that in your classes you know in the last few years i'm sure that you have heard
Customer 403.287375 404.820000 oh yeah
Agent 404.551875 411.323625 yeah well um i don't know i guess we complain about taxes but i guess you know uh you have to be sort of
Customer 404.820000 410.051750 [silence]
Customer 410.051750 415.526000 yeah yeah you you got to look to what they put you know you have decent roads at least [laughter]
Agent 411.323625 412.744125 [silence]
Agent 412.744125 418.630000 yeah you have to appreciate yeah what what you do get for them sometimes and um
Customer 415.526000 417.153875 [silence]
Customer 417.153875 418.656250 yeah
Agent 418.630000 433.050375 i guess it's it's worse you know i'd rather s[ee]- be able s[ee]- to control my money as much as i do with what's left over after taxes than to live in oh England or um some some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all
Customer 418.656250 424.490750 [silence]
Customer 424.490750 425.841625 uh-huh

Customer 432.241625 433.817250 that's true
Agent 433.050375 437.811750 and so you know i guess it's all relative [laughter]
Customer 433.817250 435.168125 [silence]
Customer 435.168125 438.790875 [laughter] it's how you look at it too [laughter]
Agent 437.811750 439.835375 yeah that's exactly right
Customer 438.790875 446.932875 i like to instead of thinking how much you know that i'm paying out i like to just look at it and say oh well everyone else is doing it too you [laughter-know]
Agent 439.835375 446.226750 [silence]
Agent 446.226750 448.123875 that's right yeah and i
