Customer 32.331375 44.593000 [silence]
Agent 36.416875 37.893125 first
Agent 37.893125 39.631375 and uh
Agent 39.631375 41.395375 then
Agent 41.395375 45.983625 from there if there's anything left [laughter]
Customer 44.593000 45.779375 yeah
Customer 45.779375 47.013375 [silence]
Agent 45.983625 47.924000 try and save some of it
Customer 47.013375 48.212875 right
Agent 47.924000 49.640250 but uh
Customer 48.212875 52.307250 [silence]
Agent 49.640250 53.180000 how you want to go ahead and say what you do
Customer 52.307250 58.006000 yeah sure what we uh what we try to do is of course you have to pay your your necessities first right
Agent 53.180000 57.508000 [silence]
Agent 57.508000 58.957250 uh-huh
Customer 58.006000 68.562250 and uh you know your rent and whatever else and uh and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is uh you know how little or or whatever you know
Agent 58.957250 67.471125 [silence]
Agent 67.471125 68.981250 uh-huh
Customer 68.562250 75.495375 and uh and then after that then we have then our our you know spending money or whatever for for miscellaneous things
Agent 68.981250 86.941000 [silence]
Customer 75.495375 82.922500 but one thing that we've used and it's it's it's kind of good because i[t]- g[ives]- it gives you uh kind of a savings plan sort of
Customer 82.922500 89.871500 and uh what it is we have a ledger you know just a a book and in it in it we have different accounts
Agent 86.941000 88.415250 uh-huh
Agent 88.415250 95.537500 [silence]
Customer 89.871500 96.105875 uh that let's say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something that's what would go into savings for instance
Agent 95.537500 96.936500 uh-huh
Customer 96.105875 103.361125 uh we have it so that in that ledger you know the bank just just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings
Agent 96.936500 102.802500 [silence]
Agent 102.802500 104.186750 uh-huh
Customer 103.361125 109.319500 well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories
Agent 104.186750 113.669375 [silence]
Customer 109.319500 118.368125 so for instance uh let's say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair uh maintenance or whatever another
Agent 113.669375 114.913875 uh-huh
Agent 114.913875 116.844875 [silence]
Agent 116.844875 119.779375 so you've already got it there when you've got the
Customer 118.368125 126.246500 right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to uh you know kids toys or something you know
Agent 119.779375 125.687375 [silence]
Agent 125.687375 127.022000 yeah
Customer 126.246500 133.568500 and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that
Agent 127.022000 143.253250 [silence]
Customer 133.568500 143.837000 you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars saved for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever howe[ver]- you know [vocalized-noise] up to a hundred twenty dollars
Agent 143.253250 145.015875 that's a good idea
Customer 143.837000 152.813500 y[eah]- yeah and that's how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car [vocalized-noise] you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that
Agent 145.015875 152.084250 [silence]
Agent 152.084250 153.342500 yeah
Customer 152.813500 154.886250 and and it seems to work
Agent 153.342500 158.721500 [noise] you don't just go overboard spending too much of the savings on one particular thing
Customer 154.886250 157.779625 [silence]
Customer 157.779625 159.606750 right right
Agent 158.721500 164.049125 that's a good idea when we have some money we'll do that [laughter]
Customer 159.606750 162.003375 and so it you know it seems to
Customer 162.003375 163.094750 [laughter]
Customer 163.094750 168.442625 it it seems to work pretty good you know the the only part is you got to keep track of it you know every every month of stuff
Agent 164.049125 167.961000 [silence]
Agent 167.961000 169.399500 yeah
Customer 168.442625 174.275625 but that seems to work pretty good and uh see other things we do is just uh
Agent 169.399500 179.882625 [silence]
Customer 174.275625 176.029375 just try to uh
Customer 176.029375 180.527125 just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know
Agent 179.882625 181.347250 yeah
Customer 180.527125 188.177375 and uh we try to you know make sure where we go and uh try to catch something on sale or or something like that
Agent 181.347250 187.022250 [silence]

Customer 213.638125 215.280000 right uh-huh
Customer 215.280000 221.230500 [silence]

Customer 221.230500 222.482875 uh-huh
Agent 222.386625 227.255125 and uh that has helped a lot um
Customer 222.482875 232.229000 [silence]
Agent 227.255125 232.894625 and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need
Customer 232.229000 233.468625 uh-huh
Agent 232.894625 240.950250 so that i've got it ahead of time and i don't have to go out and buy it something not on sale because i've already gotten it on sale
Customer 233.468625 240.171125 [silence]
Customer 240.171125 241.409375 uh-huh

Customer 351.896125 358.747000 [silence]
Agent 354.975750 359.812500 try not to do is to use the credit cards because that just runs
