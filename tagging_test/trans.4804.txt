Agent 0.000000 1.106500 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 3.414625 [noise] he uh well do you use a budget
Agent 1.106500 3.395500 [silence]
Agent 3.395500 8.753625 uh i do at times off and on right now i'm probably in one of the more the more off times
Customer 3.414625 8.979500 [silence]
Agent 8.753625 14.125500 [silence]
Customer 8.979500 13.942875 any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you
Customer 13.942875 22.938000 [silence]
Agent 14.125500 19.612875 oh it works fine it's just i- i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then
Agent 19.612875 23.537250 you know there's no more uh i mean you know then it's work to catch up
Customer 22.938000 24.507625 yeah
Agent 23.537250 29.675250 uh you know then the two or three times where i've got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it
Customer 24.507625 29.267250 [silence]
Customer 29.267250 31.831625 and you do stick by it when you do it huh
Agent 29.675250 31.187500 [silence]
Agent 31.187500 33.614125 yes how about you
Customer 31.831625 33.018000 [laughter]
Customer 33.018000 44.443375 well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatever's left over i spend
Agent 33.614125 43.944625 [silence]
Agent 43.944625 45.022125 hm
Customer 44.443375 46.711625 you know i just [laughter]
Agent 45.022125 49.207250 [silence]
Customer 46.711625 49.311250 that just kind of seems to be the way it works
Agent 49.207250 51.430500 the budget i stuck on the most
Customer 49.311250 51.168500 [silence]
Customer 51.168500 52.698250 pardon me
Agent 51.430500 57.415625 was the the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget
Customer 52.698250 56.934000 [silence]
Customer 56.934000 58.488125 and
Agent 57.415625 61.414625 and basically ten percent of your income goes to uh
Customer 58.488125 63.355875 [silence]
Agent 61.414625 64.086875 uh long-term savings
Customer 63.355875 64.819000 um-hum
Agent 64.086875 66.229375 twenty percent goes toward
Customer 64.819000 89.269875 [silence]
Agent 66.229375 70.449250 uh basically short-term you know doing going out to dinner
Agent 70.449250 79.252750 like going to the movies uh maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know so[mething]- something a l[ittle]- little more short-term than like the long-term budget
Agent 79.252750 89.377500 and then the o[ther]- and then seventy percent goes toward uh uh you know paying debts and and and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first you're more likely to stick with it
Customer 89.269875 98.986375 yes and i know th[at]- that theory unfortunately neither i'm marr[ied]- married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self-control in the world
Agent 89.377500 98.350750 [silence]
Agent 98.350750 99.433750 hm
Customer 98.986375 110.577125 and uh so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh we'll save it this month we'll think well oh gee we'll buy this lamp or this whatever you know
Agent 99.433750 110.076000 [silence]
Agent 110.076000 111.463500 sure
Customer 110.577125 116.522125 so uh our s[avings]- our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain
Agent 111.463500 117.970000 [silence]
Customer 116.522125 118.613875 but are you married
Agent 117.970000 121.454375 uh i will be a week from next Monday
Customer 118.613875 120.651750 [silence]
Customer 120.651750 124.570750 oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way
Agent 121.454375 123.937125 [silence]
Agent 123.937125 125.467875 no not really
Customer 124.570750 128.047000 have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee
Agent 125.467875 127.372250 [silence]
Agent 127.372250 133.051500 yeah yeah so far for now i think uh i mean for now we've still got our own money really
Customer 128.047000 139.890625 [silence]
Agent 133.051500 134.438875 uh
Agent 134.438875 140.612375 and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something
Customer 139.890625 141.142125 uh-huh
Agent 140.612375 144.519500 in which case you know it's very convenient to once again throw everything together
Customer 141.142125 144.882750 [silence]
Agent 144.519500 146.081250 uh
Customer 144.882750 148.352875 well i agree it's uh
Agent 146.081250 155.623375 [silence]
Customer 148.352875 157.436875 maybe for us anyway it's easier just to to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it
Agent 155.623375 157.876250 right right
Customer 157.436875 161.883500 but uh but we just kind of started out that way and
Agent 157.876250 160.903125 [silence]
Agent 160.903125 166.138750 yeah a[nd]- and right now in my case it's more situation that uh that she uh
Customer 161.883500 169.105125 [silence]
Agent 166.138750 168.858500 uh has still got a lot of debt
Agent 168.858500 171.785625 and it's easier for me to kind of like just shoulder
Customer 169.105125 170.158875 oh
Customer 170.158875 172.837875 [silence]
Agent 171.785625 173.425375 the normal stuff
Customer 172.837875 174.094875 uh-huh
Agent 173.425375 175.882250 and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt
Customer 174.094875 175.146375 [silence]
Customer 175.146375 181.589375 well that's a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married [laughter-too]
Agent 175.882250 178.541875 [silence]
Agent 178.541875 180.240875 [laughter]
Agent 180.240875 187.666625 well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because_1 i didn't like it
Customer 181.589375 187.987625 [silence]
Agent 187.666625 189.416625 [silence]
Customer 187.987625 189.956625 uh no it's not a whole lot of fun
Agent 189.416625 190.466375 so
Customer 189.956625 205.841375 [silence]
Agent 190.466375 191.439500 [laughter]
Agent 191.439500 193.237250 i think it's people in general
Agent 193.237250 196.987375 yeah you have a tendenc[y]- that's a tendency to do it when you can
Agent 196.987375 198.446625 uh
Agent 198.446625 204.085375 one of the ways i insure my long-term savings is the fact that you know i've got a 401K plan so i've got
Agent 204.085375 209.180250 uh five percent of my income going into that uh that's actually five percent before taxes
Customer 205.841375 207.191375 um-hum
Customer 207.191375 208.473625 [silence]
Customer 208.473625 209.743000 um-hum
Agent 209.180250 213.564000 uh that cou[ld]- you know so that's even more and then i've also uh
Customer 209.743000 217.156375 [silence]
Agent 213.564000 217.509875 uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions
Customer 217.156375 225.114750 which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything
Agent 217.509875 218.497125 yeah
Agent 218.497125 224.996000 [silence]
Agent 224.996000 226.468125 abso[lutely]-
Customer 225.114750 233.587875 or you know even if it's of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i'm sure but once it goes into the checking account it's awfully hard to transfer it over
Agent 226.468125 232.926625 [silence]
Agent 232.926625 240.484750 right well i've i've even got a uh fifty dollar a month uh uh mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month
Customer 233.587875 239.387500 [silence]
Customer 239.387500 241.234750 that's a good idea
Agent 240.484750 244.101625 you know once again you know you know it's there you know it's going to happen
Customer 241.234750 248.852875 [silence]
Agent 244.101625 245.586625 it's a uh
Agent 245.586625 247.622000 an easier way to uh
Agent 247.622000 248.800625 to save
Agent 248.800625 257.481375 [silence]
Customer 248.852875 249.999125 um-hum
Customer 249.999125 258.378375 and uh your fiancee i[s]- she'll she goes along with the savings part too even though uh she's managed to get herself into debt
Agent 257.481375 259.471125 no she has no saying [laughter]
Customer 258.378375 262.242875 [laughter]
Agent 259.471125 261.503000 [silence]
Agent 261.503000 263.041750 [laughter]
Customer 262.242875 264.994250 [laughter] but you're going to manage to make her stick to your plan right
Agent 263.041750 264.901625 [silence]
Agent 264.901625 271.517750 well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but
Customer 264.994250 266.874125 [laughter]
Customer 266.874125 268.331875 [silence]
Customer 268.331875 269.607375 um-hum
Customer 269.607375 278.607375 [silence]
Agent 271.517750 279.083625 i i think until you know we're we're both growing [vocalized-noise] because you know of that i think it'll probably stay away for awhile
Customer 278.607375 290.379625 well actually i know some people a a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts that's the way they prefer it uh
Agent 279.083625 292.530375 [silence]
Customer 290.379625 298.402000 you know uh she doesn't go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but it's everybody as long as i think uh your
Agent 292.530375 293.718500 right
Agent 293.718500 298.402000 [silence]
