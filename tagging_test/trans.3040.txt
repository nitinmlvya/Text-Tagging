Agent 0.000000 1.072875 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 15.812500 [silence]
Agent 1.072875 4.058375 well we uh taxes
Agent 4.058375 14.057750 everyone thinks taxes are too high i'm sure but uh i think we do get quite a v[alue]- good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases
Agent 14.057750 15.620625 what do you think
Agent 15.620625 46.698500 [silence]
Customer 15.812500 19.738750 uh yeah i i think so i i
Customer 19.738750 21.397125 uh
Customer 21.397125 23.121750 [silence]
Customer 23.121750 27.009625 i i think i'm i think i'm uh
Customer 27.009625 32.056625 a little out of the ordinary in that that i i uh
Customer 32.056625 42.455125 i think i'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to
Customer 42.455125 52.095750 either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled and and uh
Agent 46.698500 49.815250 [laughter] at this stage it's hard to tell [laughter]
Agent 49.815250 51.801500 [silence]
Agent 51.801500 53.202250 [noise]
Customer 52.095750 54.888625 and uh
Agent 53.202250 66.658875 [silence]
Customer 54.888625 66.739875 i know i'm a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes so i'm not i'm uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that
Agent 66.658875 68.114375 yes
Customer 66.739875 69.582500 uh for Texas and and
Agent 68.114375 80.608250 well at this stage i think we've taxed property almost to the limit because like the the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home
Customer 69.582500 72.887250 [silence]
Customer 72.887250 74.904000 yeah i think so
Customer 74.904000 83.257000 [silence]
Agent 80.608250 90.213500 because of the cost of the taxes on them i know i live in Richardson and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
Customer 83.257000 84.758750 yeah
Customer 84.758750 86.117125 yeah
Customer 86.117125 89.398375 [silence]
Customer 89.398375 91.551375 yeah yeah
Agent 90.213500 101.100000 but now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there uh look what the schools could cost you
Customer 91.551375 100.584750 [silence]
Customer 100.584750 114.312875 yeah yeah yeah now i'm uh uh you know i'd we'd when we moved to R[ichardson]- Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that that
Agent 101.100000 121.821750 [silence]
Customer 114.312875 123.753875 that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that because we supported the
Agent 121.821750 122.877000 yeah
Agent 122.877000 134.376625 then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the p[ublic]- public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country
Customer 123.753875 128.454625 [silence]
Customer 128.454625 129.678500 yeah
Customer 129.678500 134.126875 [silence]
Customer 134.126875 135.447750 yeah
Agent 134.376625 140.969625 uh one of the uh i believe i don't know which one it is uh down there whether it's Hobby or uh [noise]
Customer 135.447750 152.448000 [silence]
Agent 140.969625 153.505375 the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
Customer 152.448000 154.420250 yeah i think that's right
Agent 153.505375 156.268375 yeah that would provide uh
Customer 154.420250 160.818875 [silence]
Agent 156.268375 169.160875 possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see the so called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount but
Customer 160.818875 162.072875 yeah
Customer 162.072875 173.020750 [silence]
Agent 169.160875 174.615500 i pay eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even [laughter]
Customer 173.020750 179.345750 [laughter] [laughter-i] i don't i don't know about that i [laughter]
Agent 174.615500 177.666875 [noise]
Agent 177.666875 182.257375 yeah [laughter] well i quit ten years ago so [laughter]
Customer 179.345750 184.058625 i i see okay no uh
Agent 182.257375 185.273625 i couldn't afford to start again [laughter]
Customer 184.058625 188.467250 yeah well that that that would be true that would be true but
Agent 185.273625 186.529375 [silence]
Agent 186.529375 191.725750 i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think
Customer 188.467250 190.878625 [silence]
Customer 190.878625 192.203500 huh
Agent 191.725750 203.940500 but all the various t[axing]- taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
Customer 192.203500 203.342125 [silence]
Customer 203.342125 209.595375 yeah and and even if it is isn't going to uh uh
Agent 203.940500 215.523250 [silence]
Customer 209.595375 217.686250 provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know
Agent 215.523250 226.420250 well this this is a thing i think it's like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it
Customer 217.686250 231.182375 [silence]
Agent 226.420250 231.516875 if we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that
Customer 231.182375 232.466125 yeah
Agent 231.516875 245.468500 and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and uh construction costs were cheap you could afford it but now digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive
Customer 232.466125 235.550000 [silence]
Customer 235.550000 237.012125 yeah
Customer 237.012125 240.064250 [silence]
Customer 240.064250 241.484125 and
Customer 241.484125 244.947250 [silence]
Customer 244.947250 255.659375 yeah and the other thing is that wh[en]- when it when it's [vocalized-noise] the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh
Agent 245.468500 260.173375 [silence]
Customer 255.659375 265.747875 business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that whereas in in uh in Dallas here we've we've got uh
Agent 260.173375 261.873125 absolutely
Agent 261.873125 303.866375 [silence]
Customer 265.747875 272.221000 those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART and uh
Customer 272.221000 273.139125 [noise]
Customer 273.139125 276.245375 for instance all the all the the uh
Customer 276.245375 285.811000 office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown uh to try to to try to provide
Customer 285.811000 292.268875 efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to
Customer 292.268875 300.188625 uh both those centers of of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there
Customer 300.188625 304.346750 as opposed to having a concentrated business area
Agent 303.866375 305.167750 yeah
Customer 304.346750 306.374125 you know like New York does yeah
Agent 305.167750 316.084375 yeah just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere and new York and some people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car
Customer 306.374125 311.149750 [silence]
Customer 311.149750 312.555250 yeah
Customer 312.555250 313.910750 yeah
Customer 313.910750 314.920125 [silence]
Customer 314.920125 316.855875 right right
Agent 316.084375 329.760500 someone made the analogy uh with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street well most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
Customer 316.855875 329.053375 [silence]
Customer 329.053375 330.692250 yeah
Agent 329.760500 331.875000 and i'm just as guilty as anyone else
Customer 330.692250 333.100375 oh yeah yeah
Agent 331.875000 337.757750 i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling
Customer 333.100375 336.905875 [silence]
Customer 336.905875 338.477125 yeah right
Agent 337.757750 340.986625 and uh most people are that way
Customer 338.477125 339.989500 [silence]
Customer 339.989500 341.270125 yep
Agent 340.986625 344.730500 because they're used to not having public transportation
Customer 341.270125 343.851375 [silence]
Customer 343.851375 345.404500 yeah
Agent 344.730500 353.990500 so but i here again i think the thing i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt
Customer 345.404500 346.966125 yeah
Customer 346.966125 353.475750 [silence]
Customer 353.475750 354.681875 yeah
Agent 353.990500 364.564250 so and doing all these studies and the things we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something that
Customer 354.681875 363.439750 [silence]
Customer 363.439750 369.591625 [laughter]
Agent 364.564250 370.744500 [laughter] i felt that was a little uh wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying
Customer 369.591625 372.547875 a little bit much oh yeah yep
Agent 370.744500 371.801875 you know
Agent 371.801875 373.553000 [silence]
Customer 372.547875 375.139875 yep yeah we c[ould]-
Agent 373.553000 376.519875 well that's about all i can say at this time
Customer 375.139875 378.318750 yeah i th[ink]- i think so i think that will probably do it so
Agent 376.519875 378.921125 okay it's been real nice talking with you
Customer 378.318750 380.481750 good enough bye
Agent 378.921125 380.091875 bye
Agent 380.091875 382.435875 [noise]
Customer 380.481750 382.435875 [noise]
