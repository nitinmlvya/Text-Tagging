Customer 5.147000 15.412000 [silence]
Customer 15.412000 29.211500 oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it

Agent 75.395250 87.348875 what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs
