Agent 0.000000 0.087250 [noise]

Agent 1.419625 9.629375 [silence]
Customer 2.763375 3.905500 [silence]
Customer 3.905500 11.410000 besides y[our]- besides your salary what's what's the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit
Agent 9.629375 10.687625 yeah
Agent 10.687625 13.096000 well i guess uh
Customer 11.410000 19.431125 [silence]
Agent 13.096000 20.559750 i i i'm kind of in uh in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because i'm self-employed
Customer 19.431125 21.031125 oh
Agent 20.559750 22.193375 uh
Customer 21.031125 24.453250 have you ever worked for a large organization

Customer 24.453250 26.344250 oh okay
Customer 26.344250 43.432500 [silence]
Agent 26.876750 31.638875 uh and i suppose that uh
Agent 31.638875 36.034125 so far as benefits are concerned the most important
Agent 36.034125 43.641125 to uh me today would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits
Customer 43.432500 44.977875 okay
Agent 43.641125 53.880000 at at this point in my life though i'm i'm i'm a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh
Customer 44.977875 51.692875 [silence]
Customer 51.692875 53.066000 uh-huh
Customer 53.066000 65.372000 [silence]
Agent 53.880000 59.790000 in you know in my younger days i i was interested in what's the vacation policy
Agent 59.790000 65.447625 and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know
Customer 65.372000 66.717875 yeah
Agent 65.447625 70.696500 but uh so i i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on
Customer 66.717875 75.372750 [silence]
Agent 70.696500 72.606500 uh you know on
Agent 72.606500 76.176625 where you are in life as to what's most important
Customer 75.372750 81.004500 yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once
Agent 76.176625 77.706875 and uh
Agent 77.706875 79.314000 yeah
Agent 79.314000 86.815625 yeah uh you know if you're not uh if you haven't haven't looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire
Customer 81.004500 86.205125 [silence]
Customer 86.205125 87.565750 uh-huh
Agent 86.815625 94.557375 when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it then it gets to be important because you've got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the company is not doing it for you
Customer 87.565750 91.153375 [silence]
Customer 91.153375 93.616500 yeah that's true
Customer 93.616500 95.453250 that's true
Agent 94.557375 96.501875 and uh
Customer 95.453250 103.108875 [silence]
Agent 96.501875 103.666125 there are you know there are companies that do and there companies that don't you know that don't have good retirement plans
Customer 103.108875 104.480625 uh-huh
Agent 103.666125 105.014250 uh
Customer 104.480625 116.853625 [silence]
Agent 105.014250 117.635375 i guess uh the companies that participate in the 401K type plans where you know you have the the uh option of contributing to uh to a retirement plan
Customer 116.853625 118.176000 uh-huh
Agent 117.635375 125.120625 and uh maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that that's those are good programs uh
Customer 118.176000 123.729125 [silence]
Customer 123.729125 125.006500 yeah
Customer 125.006500 127.759375 [silence]
Agent 125.120625 134.320000 i i i'm a CPA so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these uh a lot of different programs and things and along that line
Customer 127.759375 129.119500 uh-huh
Customer 129.119500 140.006375 [silence]
Agent 134.320000 140.763500 and uh i like to see where the company makes those makes benefits available at least to the employees
Customer 140.006375 141.363125 uh-huh
Agent 140.763500 143.601125 so that they can pick and chose what they like uh
Customer 141.363125 148.499500 [silence]
Agent 143.601125 149.404625 you know there they've got one that they call a cafeteria plan i don't know whether you're familiar with that or not
Customer 148.499500 150.513500 no what is that
Agent 149.404625 154.198500 and uh essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where
Customer 150.513500 186.485750 [silence]
Agent 154.198500 167.879875 the company makes available a a different uh uh different packages of benefits you you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an
Agent 167.879875 177.341000 and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the company essentially the total cost to the company
Agent 177.341000 182.949875 fits you know within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of benefits
Agent 182.949875 187.250125 but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them
Customer 186.485750 189.152875 um no i hadn't heard of that
Agent 187.250125 196.236000 so you can uh so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's important to them
Customer 189.152875 196.270625 [silence]
Agent 196.236000 202.093625 and the company winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one
Customer 196.270625 197.450375 um
Customer 197.450375 199.287625 [silence]
Customer 199.287625 202.446750 is that something that you should change from year to year
Agent 202.093625 209.151875 uh i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from year to year but at least you can change periodically
Customer 202.446750 210.439750 [silence]
Agent 209.151875 221.881750 uh as to you know as t[o]- to get the stuff that's more important to you yeah that's uh something that the uh that the federal government you know put into uh you know into the IRS regulations as uh as
Customer 210.439750 213.402500 that sounds like it might be a really good idea
Customer 213.402500 227.044000 [silence]
Agent 221.881750 234.343250 uh deductions uh allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago uh you know the the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans
Customer 227.044000 228.376500 uh-huh
Customer 228.376500 233.358500 [silence]
Customer 233.358500 234.697500 uh-huh
Agent 234.343250 238.279375 and uh i i think there you know it's a pretty good option to have
Customer 234.697500 243.550500 [silence]
Agent 238.279375 244.406250 of course the 401[K]- 401K is is a good you know it's a good savings vehicle
Customer 243.550500 244.820375 yeah
Agent 244.406250 246.199250 so uh
Customer 244.820375 252.391375 [silence]
Agent 246.199250 248.488500 anyway uh
Agent 248.488500 252.928625 what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before
Customer 252.391375 253.544875 well
Agent 252.928625 256.027750 [silence]
Customer 253.544875 256.942250 [noise] i think of uh you mean as far as retirement
Agent 256.027750 260.222500 well as so far as benefit packages indi[cate]- in total
Customer 256.942250 259.711750 [silence]
Customer 259.711750 266.405625 i think the the most important thing for me right now i[s]- is really the medical coverage
Agent 260.222500 265.088250 [silence]
Agent 265.088250 266.706250 uh-huh
Customer 266.405625 267.959875 uh

Customer 267.959875 270.262500 i am in uh
Agent 268.021750 278.287875 [silence]
Customer 270.262500 271.914375 [silence]
Customer 271.914375 279.094000 in uh involved in a four 401K but i'm uh contributing such a such a small amount right now
Agent 278.287875 279.556875 yeah
Customer 279.094000 283.609500 just to go ahead and have the account open because uh
Agent 279.556875 280.900875 [silence]
Agent 280.900875 282.214000 yeah
Agent 282.214000 298.629250 [silence]
Customer 283.609500 285.269875 uh
Customer 285.269875 286.618750 [silence]
Customer 286.618750 292.384750 i just let's see i've been with this company for about three months and before that
Customer 292.384750 294.270000 uh we were
Customer 294.270000 296.406375 [silence]
Customer 296.406375 299.487500 we're we're still in the process of trying to catch up
Agent 298.629250 301.996000 yeah i understand that yeah
Customer 299.487500 306.165625 we were we were way behind financially and so haven't really uh quite managed to catch up yet
Agent 301.996000 305.394875 [silence]
Agent 305.394875 306.886000 yeah so
Customer 306.165625 311.258125 exactly and we're also trying to buy a house which complicates matters even further
Agent 306.886000 309.736625 [silence]
Agent 309.736625 316.138875 right yeah it's and it's uh it it's uh uh a hassle trying to to uh
Customer 311.258125 321.332875 [silence]
Agent 316.138875 321.861250 uh put your money all in the right in the s[avings]- you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it
Customer 321.332875 322.671750 yeah
Agent 321.861250 327.992000 you know to get everything do you have children and so so they i guess the uh
Customer 322.671750 324.561000 [silence]
Customer 324.561000 326.243625 no
Customer 326.243625 330.295875 no that would complicate things even more [laughter]
Agent 327.992000 337.719375 yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had children i guess if you're of child bearing age then it's important too you know because
Customer 330.295875 332.645375 [silence]
Customer 332.645375 333.878250 yeah
Customer 333.878250 335.831875 [silence]
Customer 335.831875 338.365875 yeah that's probably
Agent 337.719375 344.909875 you know because you got to have uh at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another child or have a child
Customer 338.365875 343.220500 [silence]
Customer 343.220500 346.535125 uh-huh yeah that's true
Agent 344.909875 346.052125 and uh
Agent 346.052125 346.511875 [noise]
Agent 346.511875 348.356750 you want to have that coverage
Customer 346.535125 355.043500 [silence]
Agent 348.356750 350.444625 so anyway uh
Agent 350.444625 351.848000 [silence]
Agent 351.848000 353.851000 but what else
Agent 353.851000 356.989875 [silence]
Customer 355.043500 357.489000 well there's lets see what other
Agent 356.989875 362.879250 yeah uh i guess uh what what kind of typical vacation
Customer 357.489000 370.564875 [silence]
Agent 362.879250 369.168750 programs uh vacation plans do do the companies have that you've worked for
Agent 369.168750 372.697875 uh so far as when you get vacation and how much
Customer 370.564875 379.403250 it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like two weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months
Agent 372.697875 378.627625 [silence]
Agent 378.627625 380.335875 uh-huh
Customer 379.403250 387.716750 [silence]
Agent 380.335875 389.938625 yeah it's i have not uh i have not seen vacation policies you know written in about seven years so i'm not real sure how they're how they're changing what they're doing now
Customer 387.716750 394.851625 most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that if somebody really needs that time
Agent 389.938625 391.402375 [silence]
Agent 391.402375 392.653750 yeah
Agent 392.653750 394.456250 [silence]
Agent 394.456250 395.450125 yeah
Customer 394.851625 399.216000 they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two
Agent 395.450125 397.564500 [silence]
Agent 397.564500 400.850000 yeah but uh yeah that's a good deal
Customer 399.216000 401.906750 so it wor[k]- it would work either way
Agent 400.850000 410.478625 yeah how what do you what do you find that that they're uh when they change from two weeks to three weeks is it five years or ten years or
Customer 401.906750 410.732125 [silence]
Agent 410.478625 413.457625 [silence]
Customer 410.732125 414.176625 probably five years i think
Agent 413.457625 414.988625 yeah uh
Customer 414.176625 416.222750 or seven
Agent 414.988625 418.062875 [silence]
Customer 416.222750 418.843250 uh that's kind of far away
Agent 418.062875 419.083125 yeah
Customer 418.843250 421.356875 [laughter]
Agent 419.083125 424.349875 [noise] so that's uh that's a that's a bit of a a wait to get i know that uh
Customer 421.356875 434.559375 [silence]
Agent 424.349875 436.621250 in the past i've worked for companies you know where they they had a pretty good uh pretty good pl[an]- uh vacation policy you know you got you got the two weeks [noise] the first year and then they went up
Customer 434.559375 436.540250 okay um
