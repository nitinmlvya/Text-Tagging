Customer 90.276125 97.688500 [silence]
Agent 93.309500 105.249625 so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else

Agent 114.936250 120.587750 i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having
Agent 120.587750 125.085125 instead of um a national health insurance system having
Agent 125.085125 136.260000 a sort of like an FDIC for health insurers so if if you're health insurance company goes out of business you don't lose everything if you get sick
