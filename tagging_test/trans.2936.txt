Agent 0.000000 4.992750 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 0.134625 [noise]
Customer 0.134625 6.498625 well i've had a a little bit longer to think here because uh they waited about ten calls before they found you Bob but
Agent 4.992750 6.230500 oh really
Agent 6.230500 26.499375 [silence]
Customer 6.498625 17.724500 uh i i've been thinking about the fact that the uh Gramm-Rudman Act that was eventua[lly]- originally passed uh to s[atisfy]- to s[atisfy]- satisfy some of these deficiencies and place a
Customer 17.724500 27.674000 set of handcuffs on Congress just doesn't work because now we do things outside the Gramm-Rudman with consent of Congress i guess and that doesn't seem to help us to much
Agent 26.499375 27.995750 yeah
Customer 27.674000 36.983250 uh i mean the savings and loan was a great example of that that's outside the Gulf War was outside so it doesn't it i guess we just don't have the resolve t[o]-
Agent 27.995750 43.680000 [silence]
Customer 36.983250 44.009125 to really face up and and and follow those instructions i[f]- if indeed they are politically viable
Agent 43.680000 51.735875 yeah i believe uh i believe that's right uh i guess uh uh you know really what we've got to do is is face up to the fact that uh
Customer 44.009125 66.960500 [silence]
Agent 51.735875 59.303625 our economy just will not support uh all of the programs that you know that the the the
Agent 59.303625 71.553625 some of the people and i think it's you know the minority numbers not in minorities uh you know i'm not talking racial stuff but minori[ties]- minorities in numbers [noise] uh
Customer 66.960500 68.692875 yeah
Customer 68.692875 77.776750 [silence]
Agent 71.553625 78.424375 uh want to have passed uh special interest groups uh have you know their own agenda
Customer 77.776750 79.231625 right
Agent 78.424375 89.496000 and i think that it's time that uh Congress faces up to what i think the the people in general have faced up to is that we just cannot really support all of those things
Customer 79.231625 88.709250 [silence]
Customer 88.709250 100.431000 uh it seems to me that that there's there's a couple of ways that that i've listened to uh various Congress people and the President and the opposition and other people propose and
Agent 89.496000 109.744875 [silence]
Customer 100.431000 104.999375 and one thing that's starting to ring a little true to me is um rather severe cuts in
Customer 104.999375 116.999625 in the defense programs sin[ce]- like closing bases and closing down programs etcetera simply because i- i just don't believe as much as they want me to believe some of the special interests that you talk about
Agent 109.744875 111.586500 right
Agent 111.586500 119.365500 [silence]
Customer 116.999625 121.027000 that uh mother Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer
Agent 119.365500 122.294500 right i- i believe that's true
Customer 121.027000 134.264125 i mean we're seeing this thing just crumble i[f]- if anything now i see the President wants another bi[llion]- two and a half billion to loan them money because he's afraid of the outright uh chaos and confusion and anarchy because there's no food over there
Agent 122.294500 132.986000 [silence]
Agent 132.986000 144.142000 well i ye[ah]- you know one of the things that i look at uh uh i'm in the Dallas area and uh Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the the sponsors of the
Customer 134.264125 137.733625 [silence]
Customer 137.733625 139.289125 yeah
Customer 139.289125 147.218625 [silence]
Agent 144.142000 148.743000 the uh bill that's that called for the closing of military bases
Customer 147.218625 148.986500 yes
Agent 148.743000 161.249000 and one of the bases that's being closed or that's on the you know on the agenda to be closed is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth which is right you know right close by and when they decided that that was one that needed to be closed
Customer 148.986500 152.713375 [silence]
Customer 152.713375 154.689875 yes
Customer 154.689875 156.764625 yes

Customer 158.726625 165.997875 [silence]
Agent 161.249000 167.654875 there was really a a huge cry you know from the Dallas Fort Worth area about you know
Customer 165.997875 167.500500 yeah
Customer 167.500500 170.356375 [silence]
Agent 167.654875 176.466375 how it's you know that one is the one that should not be closed you know it's it's not fair you know [laughter-to] to Dallas Fort Worth but uh you know when Amory's
Customer 170.356375 175.947375 [laughter] exactly
Customer 175.947375 179.762125 [silence]
Agent 176.466375 182.251750 bill passed everybody said hey that's a great thing you know we're going to cut back on some of this unnecessary spending
Customer 179.762125 181.475625 yeah
Customer 181.475625 184.499500 just don't gore my ox right
Agent 182.251750 190.474250 right and uh you know i think that's the the same case that that you know would hold true for a number of other programs uh
Customer 184.499500 196.998625 [silence]
Agent 190.474250 205.188625 we all talk about uh about how the the uh transfer payments you know are not handled correctly uh you know the the welfare programs and s[ome]- and some of those things and you know they all need major overhauls
Customer 196.998625 199.458500 yes that's right
Customer 199.458500 219.703625 [silence]
Agent 205.188625 206.428625 but
Agent 206.428625 220.242500 they all need major overhauls until they're the ones you know until it's the one that that i sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from or you know the [laughter-one] that that my children or my grandchildren or my mother or grandmother
Customer 219.703625 221.495500 well
Agent 220.242500 228.608125 you know that we've all we all all got a special interest group that uh you know that's benefiting from some of these uh
Customer 221.495500 226.211000 [silence]
Customer 226.211000 239.370750 oh i guess we'd almost have to i mean i don't know it just seems to me we'd almost have to change the way we do business in government if we didn't have special interest groups i mean right down to the state and city levels and so on but i was wondering about
Agent 228.608125 236.285750 [silence]
Agent 236.285750 237.813000 yeah
Agent 237.813000 258.940125 [silence]
Customer 239.370750 246.987500 you know i- i was a little bit encouraged although it didn't seem to work out too well in this debacle in the Fall when they last Fall when they
Customer 246.987500 257.153625 they they did levy a tax on some of the p[eople]- richer people i mean they increased that bubble tax there i- i was a little encouraged by that because that's another way to cure the deficit is
Customer 257.153625 265.498875 by higher taxes nobody wants to pay higher taxes but i mean there's going to be a crisis one of these days that's going to force us to do it anyway
Agent 258.940125 260.497000 right
Agent 260.497000 263.992875 [silence]
Agent 263.992875 277.195875 right i- i- i [vocalized-noise] agree with that i i'm an accountant a CPA and i went to a seminar some seminars today and uh one of our opening speaker our keynote speaker this morning

Customer 287.725125 288.852000 [silence]
Agent 288.209125 299.998000 the state Texas is uh you know is in a little bit of a bind tax wise and one of the proposal is uh to uh have a new state income tax but to have it only on on corporations
Customer 288.852000 290.161000 yeah
Customer 290.161000 291.687000 [silence]
Customer 291.687000 293.790000 yeah yeah

Agent 299.998000 311.316125 and of course you know he's corporate president corporate uh CEO and uh that was just not the right thing you know [laughter] the the corporations are paying too much tax already so it's you know
Customer 306.746625 308.254500 yeah
Customer 308.254500 309.661375 [silence]
Customer 309.661375 316.715500 well they pass it on to us [laughter-anyway] [laughter-i] i've never i've never even thought that they that they would absorb [laughter-that]
Agent 311.316125 313.997375 [laughter-right] so the same you know
Agent 313.997375 315.684000 [silence]
Agent 315.684000 327.278250 right the same you know same thing applies you know if the tax is is geared t[o]- you know or or aimed toward me then it's a bad tax if it's aimed toward you it's a good tax [laughter] yeah
Customer 316.715500 321.777625 [silence]
Customer 321.777625 323.313375 yeah
Customer 323.313375 325.255375 [silence]
Customer 325.255375 336.802000 [laughter] that's right of course it that th[at]- [vocalized-noise] that's again that that issue just like you sited Amory's bill on the bases but i- i don't know i [vocalized-noise] it just seems to me
Agent 327.278250 331.746250 [silence]
Agent 331.746250 333.112125 um-hum
Agent 333.112125 348.499250 [silence]
Customer 336.802000 349.198250 that uh i mean i it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i- i think i'm correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget i[s]- i[s]- is allocated now for debt payments
Agent 348.499250 352.741000 ri[ght]- yeah i be[lieve]- at least that much
Customer 349.198250 358.303125 or interest payment on the debt but uh yeah and and and i know if i had to pay that much in my out of my salary i mean it it it's
Agent 352.741000 375.493500 [silence]
Customer 358.303125 368.291500 it it just seems to me i don't know whether it it that's kind of a colloquium just use common sense but i[t]- it just seems like there has to be some there will be a crisis at some point
Customer 368.291500 380.717250 when the Medicare programs can't pay off when the wh[en]- when they can't pay off the the the savings and loans uh uh situation when the banks can't be insured any longer when the pensions can't be insured
Agent 375.493500 376.819625 um-hum
Agent 376.819625 383.287750 [silence]
Customer 380.717250 390.971750 then people are really are going to demand something to be done but it appears to me that i don't know if there is any short term or long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place
Agent 383.287750 384.996250 um-hum
Agent 384.996250 389.498750 [silence]
Agent 389.498750 398.183000 you know i- i think that uh you know i think we're just going to have to [laughter] as as Gerald Ford said we're going to have to bite the bullet and uh uh and
Customer 390.971750 395.798625 [silence]
Customer 395.798625 405.686625 yeah but how do you get people to do that though i mean i- i- i- i- i don't even find myself you know i see i- i play that game with myself sometimes
Agent 398.183000 410.787750 [silence]
Customer 405.686625 420.182250 i know things are a little tough so i say well i'll just charge this on the credit card and i'll pay it off in a little bit and then then every once in a while i get a shock i get the credit card up to six seven thousand i say this is absolutely insane and we sort of tighten up or something comes by to pay the damn thing off but
Agent 410.787750 412.999500 um-hum
Agent 412.999500 415.333375 [silence]
Agent 415.333375 417.867000 r[ight]- yeah
Agent 417.867000 424.670875 [silence]
Customer 420.182250 431.430000 i- i- i- i- i think that we're not paying anything off i mean obviously we're not paying anything off we we've gone from the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation in the last ten years and
Agent 424.670875 425.998500 yeah
Agent 425.998500 430.730250 [silence]
Agent 430.730250 437.249250 yeah [vocalized-noise] and i- i guess that's the the problem or you know [vocalized-noise] as i see it anyway that
Customer 431.430000 441.495875 [silence]
Agent 437.249250 449.637625 we as a nation are not prepared to do what we as individuals would do and that's you know we cut off our spending and cut off our charging when our when our credit gets out of hand you know
Customer 441.495875 445.824000 [laughter] yeah that's right
Customer 445.824000 447.166875 [silence]
Customer 447.166875 454.299750 yeah i saw some Japanese guy on television today he was talking about the the the trade deficit he said
Agent 449.637625 467.144250 [silence]
Customer 454.299750 462.194750 as lon[g]- it's so it's so simple that that it was it was kind of it was kind of humorous he said as long as you continue to spend
Customer 462.194750 465.612250 more than you continue to uh sell
Customer 465.612250 479.620500 as long as you continue to buy in your country more than you continue to sell you'll have a trade deficit and until that comes under control uh the lending comes under control that that's your problem well i mean i- i started to laugh at that i mean it seems so simplistic but
Agent 467.144250 468.975250 right
Agent 468.975250 475.791000 [silence]
Agent 475.791000 477.298250 um-hum
Agent 477.298250 482.186500 [silence]
Customer 479.620500 487.271750 i guess it is the truth we just keep [laughter-buying] [laughter-this] [laughter-stuff] and we don't have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas
Agent 482.186500 483.723250 um-hum
Agent 483.723250 489.207250 [silence]
Customer 487.271750 497.460250 and it is a very complex situation but uh i- i guess but as a as an accountant do you do you find people are worried when you talk to them_1 about what our government might do or
Agent 489.207250 490.883125 right
Agent 490.883125 497.249500 [silence]
Agent 497.249500 509.999750 [noise] yeah i think uh i think [vocalized-noise] not so much about what the government might do but that you know they're worried about what they're not you know what they can't seem to do uh it's you know it's it's everybody seems to agree
Customer 497.460250 504.980375 [silence]
Customer 504.980375 508.507000 [vocalized-noise] what they can't seem yes that that that's right
Customer 508.507000 519.429000 [silence]
Agent 509.999750 523.341375 that we're really in you know in dire financial situation that something has to be done and the concern is that nothing is being done you know
Customer 519.429000 532.997625 yeah i was i guess i was a little comforted by the fact that on this Gulf War uh that we have received uh at least sixty percent of the money [laughter] that we asked for and i- i should imagine
Agent 523.341375 529.964625 [silence]
Agent 529.964625 531.661250 [laughter-right]
Agent 531.661250 537.277875 [silence]
Customer 532.997625 538.169500 i don't know how that's coming you know i remember some i- i just don't i haven't seen a real accounting of that
Agent 537.277875 540.819250 yeah i have not uh have not seen that
Customer 538.169500 539.233625 [silence]
Customer 539.233625 548.667750 so i guess i guess uh uh if i was to take a position now and sum up because_1 i don't want to talk too long is that the short term i guess we have to
Agent 540.819250 556.996500 [silence]
Customer 548.667750 559.481375 some how as you say address those issues in the long term we'd either have t[o]- we'd have to raise taxes and cut back on some of the big the transfer payments and the military an and just bite that bullet
Agent 556.996500 565.912375 right i and i'm i believe that's right okay okay [laughter-okay] [laughter-nice] [laughter-talking] to you uh-huh bye
Customer 559.481375 565.494625 okay i'm going to cut it off and uh because_1 i've got to [laughter-go] nice talking to you Bob bye-bye
