Customer 51.889250 72.703875 [silence]
Agent 58.888625 69.728625 although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um
Agent 69.728625 74.699500 set hospitals in the area they call it network hospitals they're hos[pitals]-
Customer 72.703875 75.410000 oh yeah i've heard of that
Agent 74.699500 85.421000 yeah they're hospitals that they're uh agreeing with uh TI that they'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep co[sts]- you know costs down

Customer 85.851500 92.004875 [silence]
Customer 92.004875 93.761250 yeah
Agent 92.763375 104.319500 you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get
Customer 93.761250 102.504875 [silence]
Customer 102.504875 103.867000 um-hum
Customer 103.867000 120.282750 [silence]
Agent 104.319500 112.950125 we have some dental coverage now um but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile Like i've had a couple of crowns recently and
Agent 112.950125 122.505625 if you didn't have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown so i i p[ay]-
Customer 120.282750 122.698000 yeah it can
Agent 122.505625 126.315500 yeah i pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month
Customer 122.698000 130.783000 [silence]
Agent 126.315500 131.780375 because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more
Customer 130.783000 132.126625 uh-huh
Agent 131.780375 140.558250 um we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that
Customer 132.126625 139.912000 [silence]
Customer 139.912000 143.394000 oh i like to think about [laughter-that]
Agent 140.558250 142.481625 [laughter]
Agent 142.481625 150.651625 after you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there i don't think's it's going to pay too long when i get out

Customer 146.905750 148.522375 [laughter]

Agent 155.003250 169.499000 it's not an i R A it's called a four oh one K plan it's kind of like pension you put in so much money and then TI um meets you half way up to a certain maximum so like i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents so
Customer 167.438125 169.246000 uh-huh
Customer 169.246000 176.503375 [silence]
Agent 169.499000 177.731250 that grows pretty good and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan
Customer 176.503375 177.908625 um-hum
Agent 177.731250 184.338000 course you can buy stock in the company but you know that's not always a real for sure kind of thing course

Agent 184.338000 192.366375 yeah especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down i don't know if it's any different than other companies but you hate to have it fluctuate and like

Agent 339.249875 340.398750 yeah

Customer 364.489125 368.045625 [silence]
Customer 368.045625 372.449000 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 372.449000 374.768250 [silence]
Customer 374.768250 383.330125 yeah uh-huh he has it really nice it's nice where he works and um he seems to be very happy you know
Agent 376.971000 397.516125 [silence]
Customer 383.330125 393.719875 like his hospitalization and you know he has all that and with his doctors and stuff they have um a list of doctors that the employees can go to
Customer 393.719875 397.510375 and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor
Customer 397.510375 402.589750 you know and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any
Agent 397.516125 399.696750 oh yeah okay
Agent 399.696750 408.280000 [silence]
Customer 402.589750 408.440000 but you have to go you know to certain ones but still that works out really nice you know
Agent 408.280000 416.640000 yeah we're doing an HMO right now um and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars
Customer 408.440000 417.082250 [silence]
Agent 416.640000 430.449625 so but so you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription like my husband always takes [vocalized-noise] which is kind of like you know contact stuff only better um you that's like a buck a capsule
Customer 417.082250 419.158500 that's not bad either
Customer 419.158500 429.120250 [silence]
Customer 429.120250 430.689125 um-hum
Agent 430.449625 444.242125 so if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings then there's other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars and you pay five anyhow
Customer 430.689125 442.438250 [silence]
Customer 442.438250 443.884125 um-hum
Customer 443.884125 449.004000 [silence]
Agent 444.242125 449.004000 so it isn't a percentage but sometimes you work you know you manage to make
