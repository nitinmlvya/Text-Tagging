Agent 261.920500 273.499625 instead of paying them all off at every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time you know that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff
Customer 269.298500 271.137500 yeah yeah
Customer 271.137500 272.679625 [silence]
Customer 272.679625 276.723375 well then uh see uh that's that's one of the points which i don't
Agent 273.499625 281.769000 [silence]
Customer 276.723375 287.687500 see like i i don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas and i you know i don't wa[nt]- i don't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it's like if i want something i'll i'll ask somebody you know like
Agent 281.769000 283.285875 yeah
