Agent 26.895875 28.460750 okay
Customer 27.284750 38.417750 so i'm real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how i'm going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want
Agent 28.460750 38.981750 [silence]
Customer 38.417750 46.817375 [laughter] or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and that's it

Agent 46.055375 55.409500 right okay well that's good position to be in i guess if you don't have to worry about budgeting that what's left over goes to investments
