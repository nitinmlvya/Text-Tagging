Customer 23.513625 30.571625 okay well i'm not [laughter] this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall [laughter]
Customer 30.571625 39.125250 [noise] i just find it so easy to to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it and really trying to get out of that habit so
Customer 39.125250 40.127625 [silence]
Customer 40.127625 42.094000 i think they're kind of dangerous
Customer 42.094000 55.842375 [silence]
Agent 42.385125 45.727375 i think they are too and unfortunately um
Agent 45.727375 55.202750 we use ours in we don't use them_1 all the time but we use them_1 like at Christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them_1
Agent 55.202750 62.490000 like that [laughter] but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them_1 in half
Customer 55.842375 57.445500 um-hum
Customer 57.445500 60.491750 [silence]
Customer 60.491750 62.883000 [laughter]
Agent 62.490000 64.626000 [silence]
Customer 62.883000 66.013250 yeah me too [laughter]
Agent 64.626000 68.958375 i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them_1
Customer 66.013250 81.435000 [silence]
Agent 68.958375 73.230375 um that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think
Agent 73.230375 79.841375 when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really
Agent 79.841375 82.700375 get a lot more stuff [laughter]
Customer 81.435000 83.013625 um-hum
Agent 82.700375 85.483000 if you were just able to pay outright for it
Customer 83.013625 84.699500 [silence]
Customer 84.699500 90.341375 yeah that's true that's true seems just like our society is so um
Agent 85.483000 101.479000 [silence]
Customer 90.341375 103.448750 pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this they're really trying to get you into that uh situation because_1 they know they've really got you then
Agent 101.479000 103.429000 that's right
Agent 103.429000 104.448625 [silence]
Customer 103.448750 105.067000 so
Agent 104.448625 107.958500 yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like um
Customer 105.067000 112.108875 [silence]
Agent 107.958500 116.878750 we have a Sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well that's
Customer 112.108875 113.579125 uh-huh
Customer 113.579125 121.441125 [silence]
Agent 116.878750 120.454500 probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on
Agent 120.454500 123.589375 at that point and then it seems like
Customer 121.441125 122.959000 uh-huh
Customer 122.959000 124.966250 [silence]
Agent 123.589375 127.081000 [noise] takes forever to pay that off [laughter]
Customer 124.966250 132.175250 [laughter] it's funny that uh we've got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago
Agent 127.081000 128.500625 [noise]
Agent 128.500625 131.599125 [silence]
Agent 131.599125 132.977750 um-hum
Customer 132.175250 139.256500 and we still owe i mean i- i think like half [noise] of the amount that they cost in the first place
Agent 132.977750 138.470375 [silence]
Agent 138.470375 140.001125 wow
Customer 139.256500 144.435000 it's just uh you know you just never never get get it out
Agent 140.001125 146.744250 [silence]
Customer 144.435000 149.939000 and uh that's that's real irritating to have [laughter]
Agent 146.744250 148.509750 it sure is
Agent 148.509750 155.234625 we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards
Customer 149.939000 157.870500 [silence]
Agent 155.234625 160.180125 and the interest on the loan was cheaper [noise] than it was you know to just have that
Customer 157.870500 159.207250 uh-huh
Customer 159.207250 162.611125 [silence]
Agent 160.180125 163.665000 we haven't done it lately we probably need to do it again
Customer 162.611125 173.360000 well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed
Agent 163.665000 172.988250 [silence]
Agent 172.988250 174.346125 um-hum
Customer 173.360000 178.872125 for the truck and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills
Agent 174.346125 188.460625 [silence]
Customer 178.872125 192.082250 and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and it's gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them_1 you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time
Agent 188.460625 189.880750 um-hum
Agent 189.880750 208.180875 [silence]
Customer 192.082250 194.477125 uh until several months later that
Customer 194.477125 198.731375 we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were
Customer 198.731375 208.964125 pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them_1 and so we charged them_1 all up again
Agent 208.180875 209.571875 oh no
Customer 208.964125 219.042250 [laughter-yeah] so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem [noise] so we were paying like twice
Agent 209.571875 211.291875 [laughter]
Agent 211.291875 218.908625 [silence]
Agent 218.908625 220.731250 [noise] oh
Customer 219.042250 225.584875 um [noise] so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily [noise] but uh we're
Agent 220.731250 240.426000 [silence]
Customer 225.584875 239.248250 definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church [laughter-talking] about debt and things like that i just it's so
Customer 239.248250 245.249250 so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes
Agent 240.426000 241.902250 um-hum
Agent 241.902250 244.063125 [silence]
Agent 244.063125 250.482625 i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car
Customer 245.249250 248.264625 [silence]
Customer 248.264625 249.766500 um-hum
Customer 249.766500 250.885375 yeah
Agent 250.482625 259.934250 and uh if you could stick to that you know we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion [laughter] and everything else

Customer 252.844500 256.507500 [silence]

Agent 282.292500 283.712250 um-hum
Agent 283.712250 293.983375 [silence]
Customer 288.031000 295.008875 so he said okay we'll keep it and then we weren't smart enough to not use it so [noise]
