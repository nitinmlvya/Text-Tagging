Agent 16.547500 18.090000 um
Agent 18.090000 20.148625 for a number of reasons

Agent 221.398500 222.664500 uh-huh
Agent 222.664500 227.101875 [silence]
Customer 222.745500 229.331625 i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good
Agent 227.101875 231.109000 well i found you know i found in um
Customer 229.331625 232.988250 [silence]
Agent 231.109000 233.360125 in traveling overseas
Customer 232.988250 234.103500 uh-huh
Agent 233.360125 235.838125 that uh
Customer 234.103500 241.912500 [silence]
Agent 235.838125 236.877750 [silence]
Agent 236.877750 238.167625 often
Agent 238.167625 239.174375 [silence]
Agent 239.174375 244.818250 it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card
Customer 241.912500 243.330625 uh-huh
Customer 243.330625 244.933750 [silence]
Agent 244.818250 245.839750 [silence]
Customer 244.933750 246.394500 oh really
Agent 245.839750 249.403625 for uh for hotel bills and so forth
Customer 246.394500 249.001625 [silence]
Customer 249.001625 250.279625 yeah
Agent 249.403625 251.378500 plus i would uh
Customer 250.279625 263.386125 [silence]
Agent 251.378500 252.383125 [silence]
Agent 252.383125 253.835500 when they
Agent 253.835500 255.276125 uh
Agent 255.276125 259.417125 would send the bill and they would automatically convert
Agent 259.417125 261.256875 to the
Agent 261.256875 263.029625 exchange rate
Agent 263.029625 264.081750 [silence]
Customer 263.386125 265.634375 right right
Agent 264.081750 265.357750 so
Agent 265.357750 272.585625 now the only t[ime]- time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically
Customer 265.634375 272.572125 [silence]
Customer 272.572125 273.968625 uh-huh
Agent 272.585625 273.586125 [silence]
Agent 273.586125 277.090875 uh for example i remember on one trip to France
Customer 273.968625 286.643875 [silence]
Agent 277.090875 278.119375 [silence]
Agent 278.119375 280.702000 when i started planning the trip
Agent 280.702000 282.435375 i think uh
Agent 282.435375 283.437500 [silence]
Agent 283.437500 286.349000 a dollar was worth nine or ten francs
Agent 286.349000 287.351250 [silence]
Customer 286.643875 287.914250 uh-huh
Agent 287.351250 291.377250 and just in a matter of a week or two
Customer 287.914250 302.581625 [silence]
Agent 291.377250 292.379625 [silence]
Agent 292.379625 298.073375 the dollar fell against the franc drastically and whe[n]- when i finally got over there
Agent 298.073375 302.810875 it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar so the
Customer 302.581625 304.341125 wow
Agent 302.810875 304.863375 [laughter] so
Customer 304.341125 306.608500 [silence]
Agent 304.863375 308.666875 i got caught a little short in that regard but uh
Customer 306.608500 308.552500 wow
Customer 308.552500 309.863125 yeah
Agent 308.666875 309.682000 [silence]
Agent 309.682000 313.575375 uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh
Customer 309.863125 317.809625 [silence]
Agent 313.575375 315.102250 let's say if it were
Agent 315.102250 317.895750 say sixty or seventy francs a night
Customer 317.809625 319.258250 right
Agent 317.895750 321.272000 that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so
Customer 319.258250 327.763750 [silence]
Agent 321.272000 325.375500 or maybe twenty doll[ars]- maybe it would be more than that it was more than [vocalized-noise]
Agent 325.375500 329.136000 it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate
Customer 327.763750 329.869500 right right
Agent 329.136000 330.841625 but then [laughter]
Customer 329.869500 334.926625 [silence]
Agent 330.841625 335.038625 when i got back and i was working for the government at the time
Customer 334.926625 336.356250 uh-huh
Agent 335.038625 343.575250 uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate
Customer 336.356250 340.354750 [silence]
Customer 340.354750 341.472875 right yeah
Customer 341.472875 343.659000 [silence]
Agent 343.575250 351.885000 so there's a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate
Customer 343.659000 344.909750 right
Customer 344.909750 349.187125 [silence]
Customer 349.187125 350.628875 yeah
Customer 350.628875 351.771250 [silence]
Customer 351.771250 353.613750 right
Agent 351.885000 353.533125 [laughter]
Agent 353.533125 356.778500 that that was the only time i really got caught short and i
Customer 353.613750 354.799000 yeah especially
Customer 354.799000 356.246125 [silence]
Customer 356.246125 357.726250 yeah
