Agent 74.836375 76.040000 um-hum
Customer 75.415125 79.475500 uh because of the uh improvement in real estate prices
Agent 76.040000 86.950000 [silence]
Customer 79.475500 84.329375 and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house

Agent 88.353250 103.288000 [silence]
Customer 90.624000 103.656375 improvement in uh income and uh investments and so forth has not uh come at the rate i've expected so we're still kind of hurting by the uh high mortgage payments and we haven't gotten out from under them yet
Agent 103.288000 104.598000 yeah
Customer 103.656375 104.713000 [silence]

Customer 141.295750 158.330625 [silence]

Agent 150.510125 155.640000 you know those kinds of things uh we don't have a lot of uh
Agent 155.640000 167.598625 you know like JC Penny's in our [laughter] in our budget and uh maybe twice a year we're to where i can let my wife go clothes shopping like that and

Agent 187.591875 196.327500 you know like for going to the doctor and that kind of thing so that's not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously

Agent 204.399375 206.739250 really well that's neat
Customer 205.064500 213.657375 uh which is a big help uh one of our big problems though is handling unexpected uh uh budget items
Agent 206.739250 213.523875 [silence]
Agent 213.523875 214.920125 yeah
Customer 213.657375 217.428375 like this month the uh heat pump went out and uh
Agent 214.920125 216.079000 [silence]

Agent 218.448500 219.638375 [silence]
Agent 219.638375 221.373250 wow
Customer 221.167375 223.066000 [silence]
Agent 221.373250 223.320125 so what do you do
Customer 223.066000 229.741000 well uh we have to cut into the savings uh at this point to uh to buffer that
Agent 223.320125 227.475125 [silence]
Agent 227.475125 228.964000 oh
Agent 228.964000 230.452875 wow
Customer 229.741000 231.232625 and
Agent 230.452875 233.362375 well that's good that you have the savings to get into
Customer 231.232625 233.215125 [silence]
Customer 233.215125 239.173500 then maybe we'll go for a week or two and or a month or two and then the car [laughter-breaks] [laughter-down] [laughter]
Agent 233.362375 237.874500 [silence]
Agent 237.874500 239.363625 [laughter]
Customer 239.173500 243.285625 so it's the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget
Agent 239.363625 240.852750 wow
Agent 240.852750 242.936375 [silence]
Agent 242.936375 244.383000 yeah that's
Customer 243.285625 250.412125 [silence]
Agent 244.383000 250.809750 that's the way we are we've had a lot of unexpected things just in the last uh couple months
Customer 250.412125 251.579625 yeah
Agent 250.809750 261.025625 that uh really hit us hard but i've been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses
Customer 251.579625 277.970500 [silence]
Agent 261.025625 271.138000 so but we've never been we've been married for uh nearly four years and we've never been able to save any money and i think it's just
Agent 271.138000 281.223375 hit both of us uh just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it
Customer 277.970500 279.164500 yeah
Customer 279.164500 295.641500 [silence]
Agent 281.223375 284.191375 even if it's you know ten dollars a week
Agent 284.191375 289.919000 and so we're going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago
Agent 289.919000 295.278125 and that was uh i think that was a really wise decision
Agent 295.278125 299.116125 [silence]
Customer 295.641500 298.966250 well do you have some uh savings plans at work
Customer 298.966250 309.286000 [silence]
Agent 299.116125 304.185875 no actually i'm i'm not involved in anything like that at work or
Agent 304.185875 309.842000 uh anywhere uh i don't have anything to fall back on at all
Customer 309.286000 310.524750 yeah
Agent 309.842000 313.151250 and i- i know that's not wise but
Customer 310.524750 332.532875 [silence]
Agent 313.151250 323.539250 that's just uh where we're at right now my wife just went back to work part-time uh she can substitute teach at schools
Agent 323.539250 333.048375 and uh there's so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that uh by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work
Customer 332.532875 333.709375 yeah
Agent 333.048375 335.301750 you know everyday but

Customer 347.103000 348.305750 yeah

Agent 351.658875 364.908750 and there's and we're we're Christians and that's uh we've only been Christians for about five years but that's a a real a biblical truth in the Bible is to
Agent 364.908750 372.726375 to not be in debt and we're [laughter-really] starting to see the the the reasoning behind that
Customer 366.407625 367.875125 um-hum
Customer 367.875125 377.960625 [silence]
Agent 372.726375 378.689625 and uh because_1 we're you know we're always well i can't be [laughter-sick] this week but one day
