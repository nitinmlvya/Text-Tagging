Customer 90.392375 112.078750 [silence]
Agent 97.138000 104.118750 and uh it would probably help if we could figure out how to get them to put money back into the system instead you know
Agent 104.118750 112.181000 you take someone on welfare and you give them a job and they're paying income taxes all of a sudden you've changed it around and it's going in the other direction
Customer 112.078750 116.459250 but see r[ight]- right now we're having a hard time finding people jobs

Agent 165.057250 169.889250 well i- i- i don't think the problem so much is abuse
Agent 169.889250 173.519125 i think the problem is is just the government is trying to do too much
Agent 173.519125 181.383375 um i mean who where does it say that the government's supposed to be the one to take care of all of the people that are homeless or hungry or et cetera et cetera
Agent 181.383375 188.735875 and and where does it say that that if someone is short that they can go to the government and and get a handout
Agent 188.735875 194.865250 [silence]
Customer 189.574375 195.839125 well i know but then okay but that's here but then other countries are doing it to us

Customer 195.839125 203.795500 their when their people are hungry and all they're asking us for handouts so why shouldn't our own people be able to ask for a handout

Agent 203.705750 206.724750 [silence]
Customer 203.795500 214.088250 i mean i think we should take care of our own things right here in our own country and then if we have anything left over to share with other countries then maybe we should consider sharing
Agent 206.724750 208.152250 um-hum
Agent 208.152250 214.217500 [silence]
Customer 214.088250 223.589000 but i just don't i think we're and then they keep raising the taxes boy i'll tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and

Agent 226.656125 227.658500 [silence]
Agent 227.658500 229.070625 yeah
Customer 227.987625 239.441500 i mean you know especially if you're alone it's on one salary it's terribly hard to pay the bills and pay your house payment and a car payment and insurance is ridiculous
Agent 229.070625 233.138875 [silence]
Agent 233.138875 234.415000 yeah
Agent 234.415000 239.148125 [silence]

Agent 240.520750 254.105750 you know i think you know i've got a fairly decent job here at TI but uh when i think of y[ou]- you go to the the grocery store and you see someone working as a cashier and you think y[ou]- you know how much a cashier makes and you go how do these people get by
Customer 241.540625 251.246875 [silence]
Customer 251.246875 253.615875 not very much
Customer 253.615875 255.150750 they

Agent 256.854250 260.579625 [silence]
Customer 257.570500 262.014000 yep it's hard it's really hard i
Agent 260.579625 261.855625 yeah
Agent 261.855625 265.382875 [silence]
Customer 262.014000 266.488250 well uh no i don't know i guess if we had the answers we'd
Agent 265.382875 267.768625 [laughter]
Customer 266.488250 269.051000 we could save the country but
Agent 267.768625 270.607500 we could go run for office
Customer 269.051000 274.816500 yeah [laughter] well they all say great things when they run for office
Agent 270.607500 272.702125 [silence]
Agent 272.702125 273.927000 um-hum
Agent 273.927000 279.125875 well the thing is um you know who's really in charge of deciding how the money gets spent
Customer 274.816500 315.273625 [silence]
Agent 279.125875 287.259750 and and it's you know it's not the president the president just suggests it the ones who actually you know debate it and decide it is the is the Congress
Agent 287.259750 290.152625 and you know what the Congress is out for they're
Agent 290.152625 298.008625 they're going to do whatever it takes to make their voters happy which means bring more jobs and more federal spending to their little area
Agent 298.008625 300.015875 and uh
Agent 300.015875 310.659250 uh and that means every Congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobody's working on less money going to his area or on anybody else's area
Agent 310.659250 315.400250 and if you just if you just looked at how much Congress spends on itself it's ridiculous
Customer 315.273625 317.611375 yeah i know that
Agent 315.400250 323.785250 [silence]
Customer 317.611375 326.502750 you know and then they cut their defense i- i'm not sure if that was such a great idea that cut us really [laughter-bad] [laughter-i] just i hated to see that
Agent 323.785250 325.563500 [laughter]
Agent 325.563500 327.470000 well now the thing is
Customer 326.502750 363.159375 [silence]
Agent 327.470000 340.876625 yeah they're cutting defense which is you know there are people out there working for defense contractors who are losing money but i d[on't]- i don't mind because i think you know government is not there to give me a job Government
Agent 340.876625 351.565375 the defense is there to defend our country and they do it for whatever you know they spend whatever money they need to to do that but i don't want them to to break the budget just so that i can have a job
Agent 351.565375 355.125500 [noise] i would rather have the the government stable
Agent 355.125500 361.606375 so that i can go get a good job with someone who's not work[ing]- you know not making defense stuff
Agent 361.606375 363.387250 [silence]
Customer 363.159375 371.380375 well yeah yeah i do but i still hated to see it [laughter] i mean one of the reasons i voted for Bush was because
Agent 363.387250 365.281875 if you know what i mean
Agent 365.281875 368.118625 [silence]
Agent 368.118625 369.390125 yeah
Agent 369.390125 377.253250 [silence]
Customer 371.380375 382.532375 Reagan was so defense conscious and we were doing so well and i thought well Bush is going to just carry right on [laughter] he didn't [laughter] was i [laughter-surprised] i uh
Agent 377.253250 378.737500 um-hum
Agent 378.737500 381.231125 [silence]
Agent 381.231125 383.928125 well he didn't have much choice really
Customer 382.532375 384.463250 [silence]
Agent 383.928125 384.992750 [silence]
Customer 384.463250 387.215500 well i don't know
Agent 384.992750 386.651000 yeah
Agent 386.651000 394.962000 but but defense is not the biggest part of the federal budget either the biggest part of the budget are things like Medicare and Social Security
Customer 387.215500 396.360750 [silence]
Agent 394.962000 396.856250 and uh
Customer 396.360750 407.865750 [noise] but those are things that we we really need i hate to see the old people that don't have anybody and h[ey]- you know there are [noise] people out there that have no family or and they really depend on their Medicare
Agent 396.856250 398.368125 [silence]
Agent 398.368125 399.775875 w[ell]-
Agent 399.775875 401.103750 [silence]
Agent 401.103750 402.440250 um-hum
Agent 402.440250 405.435125 [silence]
Agent 405.435125 406.930375 yeah
Agent 406.930375 408.512875 um-hum
Customer 407.865750 414.030875 and their Social Security and maybe they're in a nursing home somewhere and they cut some of this stuff and what happens to them
Agent 408.512875 410.583250 [silence]
Agent 410.583250 411.854125 yeah
Agent 411.854125 413.278000 [silence]

Customer 414.030875 416.950125 [silence]
Customer 416.950125 419.228500 yeah [laughter]
Agent 417.774250 424.439500 well just think the federal government's insurance bill has Medicare and that's been going through the roof
Customer 419.228500 428.553875 [silence]
Agent 424.439500 429.447500 and that's why f[ederal]- you know that's that's the biggest increase in federal spending right there
Customer 428.553875 430.772625 so what's the answer
Agent 429.447500 431.689000 [silence]
Customer 430.772625 433.683875 [noise]
Agent 431.689000 436.572125 think we need to figure out a way to uh to make medical care cheaper
Customer 433.683875 444.925375 [silence]
Agent 436.572125 441.771250 why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast
Agent 441.771250 442.780375 [silence]
Agent 442.780375 448.285625 you know because_1 it's it's coming out of my paycheck it's coming out of your paycheck and it's coming out of our taxes too
Customer 444.925375 446.743500 yes yeah
Customer 446.743500 452.270125 [silence]
Agent 448.285625 451.853625 why why is these hospitals making so much money
Agent 451.853625 455.674125 [silence]
Customer 452.270125 456.904375 isn't it England that has it all state run or something

Customer 464.506500 465.709000 [silence]
Agent 465.605125 468.263875 [noise]
Customer 465.709000 467.183625 in the state
Customer 467.183625 468.899375 or the country

Customer 468.899375 471.446375 [silence]
Customer 471.446375 472.859750 uh-huh
Agent 471.920125 481.027625 and medical care there is free you just go and say i want your help and they'll help you there's couple of things though first of all it's not
Customer 472.859750 492.174875 [silence]
Agent 481.027625 487.537000 as high a quality as we expect here because it's paid for by the government instead of by us
Agent 487.537000 492.887375 and second um your taxes are a lot higher
Customer 492.174875 493.867625 oh okay
Agent 492.887375 496.740000 an awful lot higher we're talking fifty percent something like that
Customer 493.867625 496.625125 [silence]
Customer 496.625125 502.358000 so they are paying for it okay well the way i you know it was talked about
Agent 496.740000 498.006125 [silence]
Agent 498.006125 499.846750 they are paying for it
Agent 499.846750 504.084125 and and the and the just the quality of care is not as good either
Customer 502.358000 504.256000 [silence]
Agent 504.084125 506.384875 [silence]
Customer 504.256000 506.550375 well then that's not the answer
Agent 506.384875 511.446625 there has got to be a middle ground i think Canada's got a good answer but i don't know many details about it
Customer 506.550375 507.836125 [silence]
Customer 507.836125 509.149250 yeah

Customer 512.474250 514.132250 what do they do
Agent 514.016375 520.235250 it's it's some sort of government program i've heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just don't know the details on it
Customer 514.132250 519.015625 [silence]
Customer 519.015625 520.787625 oh okay

Agent 527.174125 533.530125 well something's going to have to change but you look at the Congress and you look how many of them_1 get reelected and they're the one's that have got to make the changes
Customer 528.563000 538.009000 [silence]
Agent 533.530125 537.692000 i mean i don't see anything changing because you've got the same old people in there
