Customer 109.818750 117.962875 that they don't really even get the best out of the people that are working for them_1 so it makes me wonder where we're where we're going with that
Agent 110.699625 111.726750 [silence]
Agent 111.726750 114.431500 um-hum

Customer 132.593500 141.837500 y[ou]- you know that we don't really see or notice i guess but it just seemed like if if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system
Agent 133.594750 142.040125 [silence]
Customer 141.837500 152.966875 [silence]
Agent 142.040125 145.573375 well the welfare is a good example that uh
Agent 145.573375 157.372500 you know if if welfare is handled at the local level by small groups like the churches and some of the organized charities that that get people involved directly
Customer 152.966875 155.139500 um-hum
Customer 155.139500 156.997625 um-hum
Customer 156.997625 164.141500 [silence]
Agent 157.372500 164.673500 uh then the money gets right straight to the people and there's a lot of volunteer work and and supporting that type of operation
Customer 164.141500 165.716375 yeah
Agent 164.673500 171.736625 but you let the government handle it and next thing you know you're spending four out of five dollars just to administer it
Customer 165.716375 170.992125 [silence]
Customer 170.992125 173.091000 yeah i
Agent 171.736625 174.998250 and it just seems like nothing gets down to the people

Customer 174.772000 182.774000 i think i think that's a really good point [laughter] because_1 i- i- i think you know welfare is one of the one of the big problems
Agent 174.998250 177.041000 [noise]
Agent 177.041000 178.176750 huh
Agent 178.176750 194.620375 [silence]
Customer 182.774000 186.217500 and it it's interesting that in
Customer 186.217500 196.637375 uh in a way it's interesting to me that that like in the foreign in Russia and those k[ind]- areas where they're having their struggles right now you know they're gonna have to have a welfare system
Agent 194.620375 197.544000 um-hum
Customer 196.637375 205.788875 in order f[or]- in order to improve their life over there and i i hope they don't pattern theirs after our [laughter]

Customer 205.788875 219.755875 [silence]
Agent 209.162875 220.865750 uh i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is uh real estate uh taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what they're gonna charge you next year
Customer 219.755875 221.270625 um-hum
Agent 220.865750 225.870750 but uh since i moved into this house five years ago the real estate tax has doubled
Customer 221.270625 225.989250 [silence]
Agent 225.870750 236.992000 and i'm just afraid that by the time i'm ready to retire and uh the mortgage is paid off on this house i won't be able to afford the taxes on it
Customer 225.989250 227.633875 um
Customer 227.633875 234.941125 [silence]
Customer 234.941125 238.311750 [laughter-your] monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payment
Agent 236.992000 248.488500 yeah well that was true on the last house i bought i got a thirty year mortgage on it and by the time i uh sold it the the tax payment was a bigger part of the uh
Customer 238.311750 240.118875 yeah that is the
Customer 240.118875 249.409625 [silence]
Agent 248.488500 254.711125 of the mortgage payment [noise] yeah
Customer 249.409625 257.333000 hm that that is scary because_1 that really makes you wonder what they're doing with that i
Agent 254.711125 263.426125 and i figure it just says that uh when i'm ready to retire i'm gonna have to move out of Fairfax County and get out in the country some place
Customer 257.333000 262.165125 [silence]
Customer 262.165125 263.731500 um-hum
Agent 263.426125 275.027750 uh and there's no control over it uh the accessors just come around and say okay you're assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and uh
Customer 263.731500 278.365625 [silence]
Agent 275.027750 277.254375 you know there's no recourse
Agent 277.254375 282.745250 [silence]

Agent 282.745250 287.842250 well the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the county services
Customer 283.005250 287.353375 [silence]
Customer 287.353375 288.732750 um-hum
Agent 287.842250 295.565000 uh and i- i hope that some of that is working efficiently we have a pretty good school system
Customer 288.732750 299.330000 [silence]
Agent 295.565000 299.330000 i'm a little concerned that there's too much paper work there for them_1
