Agent 22.610625 43.212500 [silence]
Customer 28.193625 41.725375 oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i can't really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time
Customer 41.725375 51.419750 and uh i think most people don't necessarily realize the cost of them_1 and they're somewhat probably getting out of hand [laughter]
Agent 43.212500 44.564375 oh
Agent 44.564375 49.869500 [silence]

Customer 51.419750 64.076250 [silence]
Agent 52.195625 57.620125 i'm not sure what the category's supposed to be uh but it was what
Agent 57.620125 64.317500 [vocalized-noise] something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company
Customer 64.076250 65.765000 well
Agent 64.317500 65.876375 uh
Customer 65.765000 68.175375 i think uh
Agent 65.876375 68.784875 [silence]
Customer 68.175375 70.655500 oh the way i go[t]-
Agent 68.784875 73.042250 other other than salary didn't it say yeah
Customer 70.655500 77.847750 right well no it didn't necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess
Agent 73.042250 77.717375 [silence]
Agent 77.717375 82.663250 well i'm i thought it said other than salary but yeah
Customer 77.847750 79.711000 such as
Customer 79.711000 90.862000 well i i imagine that's what they're referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh
Agent 82.663250 83.866875 yeah
Agent 83.866875 86.693875 [silence]
Agent 86.693875 87.931500 yeah
Agent 87.931500 89.064000 [silence]
Agent 89.064000 97.049000 well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with Chance-Vought before i joined uh
Customer 90.862000 111.007000 [silence]
Agent 97.049000 103.437625 there and ironically i left Chance-Vought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some
Agent 103.437625 115.015375 thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company [laughter]
Customer 111.007000 116.658125 [laughter] and they grew up around you didn't it [laughter]
Agent 115.015375 120.183625 and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh
Customer 116.658125 118.751125 [silence]
Customer 118.751125 119.998250 uh-huh
Customer 119.998250 122.456750 [silence]
Agent 120.183625 124.425875 then it became Dallas County's largest employer oh
Customer 122.456750 124.681125 yeah
Agent 124.425875 134.997875 but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh [vocalized-noise] besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh
Customer 124.681125 139.692125 [silence]
Agent 134.997875 141.787625 wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job
Customer 139.692125 153.020875 well i think that's one of the keys that most people uh probably put above benefits that's why i work for myself basically too [laughter-i] [laughter-want] [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-what] [laughter-i] [laughter-wanna] [laughter-do]
Agent 141.787625 148.570625 [silence]
Agent 148.570625 149.448125 yeah
Agent 149.448125 151.084000 [silence]
Agent 151.084000 160.451125 well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh
Customer 153.020875 158.454500 [silence]
Customer 158.454500 160.608375 um-hum
Agent 160.451125 164.929000 heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time
Customer 160.608375 178.617375 [silence]
Agent 164.929000 172.912000 and [vocalized-noise] it's amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them
Agent 172.912000 180.142875 [vocalized-noise] uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing
Customer 178.617375 181.536375 right right
Agent 180.142875 191.966125 and power and they they just couldn't understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others
Customer 181.536375 199.969125 [silence]
Agent 191.966125 204.167750 uh including IBM's that in the technical community salary was never first [laughter] it was usually about third and [noise] yeah
Customer 199.969125 204.786500 well i think as long as it's comparable with you know the job or can
Agent 204.167750 205.973000 right
Customer 204.786500 215.531625 that uh you aren't being [laughter] picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i
Agent 205.973000 213.046000 [silence]
Agent 213.046000 223.549750 right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort
Customer 215.531625 226.887750 [silence]
Agent 223.549750 233.978000 uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes was the salary
Customer 226.887750 229.691750 yes yes
Customer 229.691750 234.213125 [silence]
Agent 233.978000 239.833125 and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the
Customer 234.213125 235.465125 we[ll]-
Customer 235.465125 245.172500 [silence]
Agent 239.833125 251.386500 oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you [laughter-know] becau[se]- because_1 they just couldn't believe [laughter-that] that people weren't motivated by money
Customer 245.172500 248.311250 [laughter]
Customer 248.311250 250.485375 right
Customer 250.485375 256.453875 well i i wouldn't say they aren't motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are
Agent 251.386500 263.449625 [silence]
Customer 256.453875 263.971250 equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh
Agent 263.449625 275.284750 yeah well i'm sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but
Customer 263.971250 269.420125 live with for a while anyway until you had enough [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-what] [laughter-you] [laughter-wanted] [laughter-to] [laughter-do] but [laughter]
Customer 269.420125 272.842750 [silence]
Customer 272.842750 274.088625 yes
Customer 274.088625 284.147750 [silence]
Agent 275.284750 288.070000 in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could g[et]- you could get a job elsewhere anyt[ime]- any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh
Customer 284.147750 285.755625 right
Customer 285.755625 296.062125 [silence]
Agent 288.070000 298.466000 in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing
Customer 296.062125 297.419125 right
Customer 297.419125 298.466000 [silence]
