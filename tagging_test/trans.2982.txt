Agent 41.820250 52.145000 one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because_1 health care is so ridiculously expensive because_1 we're we're paying our own insurance right now
Customer 44.639000 46.124500 uh-huh
Customer 46.124500 47.770000 uh-huh

Agent 62.982625 64.050500 [silence]
Agent 64.050500 68.489375 and um so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is
Customer 65.360250 70.301000 [silence]
Agent 68.489375 76.846375 first of all health benefits because_1 it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's vi[sits]- routine doctor's visits covered my health insurance only covers um
Customer 70.301000 71.726250 right
Customer 71.726250 78.370375 [silence]
Agent 76.846375 80.424875 [noise] your emergency care and so
Customer 78.370375 81.707000 um-hum do you have major medical benefits
Agent 80.424875 82.952750 right yeah but i don't
Customer 81.707000 86.904000 that that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is
Agent 82.952750 85.208250 [silence]
Agent 85.208250 89.868625 right well my our deductible is five hundred but it's for each
Customer 86.904000 89.209000 [silence]
Customer 89.209000 93.355000 each person yeah that's pretty har[d]- that's pretty high
Agent 89.868625 92.270875 event yeah
Agent 92.270875 98.048375 right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover
Customer 93.355000 94.872875 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 94.872875 96.146375 [silence]
Customer 96.146375 99.297625 right that's that's right that's
Agent 98.048375 100.355625 [noise] doctor's visits things like that
Customer 99.297625 106.371250 and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too
Agent 100.355625 104.525125 [silence]
Agent 104.525125 106.937125 oh yeah it certainly is
Customer 106.371250 118.752375 yeah i know where my daughter works now she she course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her her wage is not
Agent 106.937125 108.216875 um
Agent 108.216875 112.769250 [silence]
Agent 112.769250 114.945750 um-hum
Agent 114.945750 115.799375 [silence]
Agent 115.799375 117.328750 wow
Agent 117.328750 120.167000 [silence]
Customer 118.752375 121.200625 not very good [laughter]
Agent 120.167000 121.480000 um-hum
Customer 121.200625 127.540500 but it's a it's a type of area we live in of course living expenses aren't as bad either though which makes a difference
Agent 121.480000 127.050375 [silence]
Agent 127.050375 130.889250 and probably the medi[cal]- care -[medi]cal care is less expensive too
Customer 127.540500 130.532375 [silence]
Customer 130.532375 136.217000 well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance but uh
Agent 130.889250 132.105500 [silence]
Agent 132.105500 133.411750 um-hum
Agent 133.411750 137.612625 [silence]
Customer 136.217000 137.226875 [silence]
Customer 137.226875 138.533625 uh
Agent 137.612625 143.319750 so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower
Customer 138.533625 140.943625 [silence]
Customer 140.943625 142.843500 uh well
Customer 142.843500 151.421250 from what i've seen from my aunt and uncle uh really from Florida up to here they're not that much different
Agent 143.319750 150.818000 [silence]
Agent 150.818000 158.714125 well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan
Customer 151.421250 154.533250 [silence]
Customer 154.533250 155.859500 uh-huh
Customer 155.859500 157.942250 [silence]
Customer 157.942250 159.773500 is that right
Agent 158.714125 163.118000 and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in Boston
Customer 159.773500 160.863750 [silence]
Customer 160.863750 162.319375 uh-huh
Customer 162.319375 164.546750 oh that's a big difference
Agent 163.118000 167.629375 and i was at one of the big hospitals in New York but that's a huge difference just between
Customer 164.546750 165.334375 [silence]
Customer 165.334375 168.107750 uh-huh uh-huh
Agent 167.629375 171.137000 you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable
Customer 168.107750 170.459625 [silence]
Customer 170.459625 172.970375 oh yeah should be
Agent 171.137000 172.243375 [silence]
Agent 172.243375 182.358250 so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have
Customer 172.970375 179.559750 [silence]
Customer 179.559750 186.450875 yes uh-huh [noise] [vocalized-noise]
Agent 182.358250 189.983000 you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and i'd go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is
Customer 186.450875 199.677000 and it'd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too um-hum oh yeah yeah my my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know
Agent 189.983000 191.469250 and i
Agent 191.469250 193.695125 it would be more convenient more productive
Agent 193.695125 194.740000 [silence]
Agent 194.740000 195.877375 i think
Agent 195.877375 199.062375 [silence]
Agent 199.062375 200.331375 uh-huh
Customer 199.677000 211.599250 and uh it it's it's i don't know how they do it i [laughter-really] [laughter-don't] you know getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and [noise] all the preparations
Agent 200.331375 209.140000 [silence]
Agent 209.140000 212.891125 and you[r]- and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that
Customer 211.599250 213.899250 um-hum um-hum
Agent 212.891125 223.633750 and that to me well that you know the those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with
Customer 213.899250 219.259000 [silence]
Customer 219.259000 220.406750 um-hum
Customer 220.406750 221.329750 [silence]
Customer 221.329750 222.705875 um-hum
Customer 222.705875 225.275375 [silence]
Agent 223.633750 228.005125 life insurance and uh retirement plans but [laughter]
Customer 225.275375 227.060000 oh
Customer 227.060000 233.882625 i don't know i think those benefits you men[tioned]- mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you the wage itself
Agent 228.005125 233.057750 [silence]
Agent 233.057750 234.342250 yeah
Customer 233.882625 244.001875 if you can get those benefits even uh they they come out to much a much better [laughter-benefit] than than an increase in your wage a lot of times
Agent 234.342250 242.639250 [silence]
Agent 242.639250 255.682875 right because_1 you're you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that
Customer 244.001875 248.064000 [silence]
Customer 248.064000 249.486250 uh-huh
Customer 249.486250 252.369125 [noise] um-hum um-hum

Customer 257.966125 260.003875 [silence]
Customer 260.003875 261.482375 uh-huh
Customer 261.482375 262.621000 [silence]
Customer 262.621000 271.836500 uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on what's going on probably you know with your child
Agent 264.735875 268.250875 [silence]
Agent 268.250875 269.816250 yep
Agent 269.816250 270.842375 [silence]

Customer 271.836500 273.888000 [silence]
Customer 273.888000 275.972375 right yeah
Agent 275.262375 278.818000 and you're less preoccupied with it i think
Customer 275.972375 277.781125 [silence]
Customer 277.781125 279.848250 right yeah
Agent 278.818000 284.851500 so but unfortunately there aren't i think IBM has started having that in certain locations

Customer 292.946500 294.726625 Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
Agent 293.514000 302.186375 yeah because_1 Pittsburgh's a big enough city too but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones

Customer 298.035000 300.748750 [silence]
Customer 300.748750 302.852750 um-hum
Agent 302.186375 306.676250 just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and
Customer 302.852750 306.204750 [silence]
Customer 306.204750 307.699500 yeah
Agent 306.676250 310.015375 things like that because_1 many times small companies offer
Customer 307.699500 312.594125 [silence]
Agent 310.015375 312.286875 better benefits
Agent 312.286875 315.200875 in terms of quality of life than larger companies
Customer 312.594125 316.108500 [vocalized-noise] uh-huh

Customer 326.280000 328.042250 [silence]

Agent 329.466625 331.770125 yeah a[nd]- and
Agent 331.770125 335.877875 you know which many times at a large company it's almost impossible
Customer 333.410500 335.250625 [silence]
Customer 335.250625 337.206500 um-hum um-hum
Agent 335.877875 338.052625 to do things like that
Customer 337.206500 341.676625 they say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be yeah
Agent 338.052625 339.713250 [silence]

Customer 344.557500 346.965750 yeah yeah yeah
Agent 345.723125 350.239250 and so it all depends on what your position is there too

Agent 389.001625 393.090250 right and they they refuse to give him more salary
Customer 390.118125 392.313375 [silence]
Customer 392.313375 394.167750 is that right
Agent 393.090250 403.202625 because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so it's new it's harder to get
