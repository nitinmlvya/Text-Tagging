Customer 138.044500 144.633875 who is putting it in i'm just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things

Customer 150.306000 153.938375 well you know it's just uh you know pass a law print up ano[ther]- billion
Agent 151.457000 154.020750 [silence]
Customer 153.938375 155.018250 [silence]
Agent 154.020750 155.037000 yeah
Customer 155.018250 156.120000 and uh
Agent 155.037000 157.532250 i don't know i- i
Customer 156.120000 157.996500 business as [laughter-usual]
Agent 157.532250 168.550250 uh i don['t]- know uh here in New Jersey we have taxes for just the necessities and i think it's uh regressive tax it's just as worse
Customer 157.996500 166.939750 [silence]
Customer 166.939750 170.704875 i'm not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean
Agent 168.550250 170.056875 [silence]
Agent 170.056875 184.786000 progressive um i[t's]- it's like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you don't really need that extra income to survive
Customer 170.704875 171.794375 yeah
Customer 171.794375 179.505875 [silence]
Customer 179.505875 180.760875 right
Customer 180.760875 184.415250 [silence]
Customer 184.415250 185.523375 um-hum
Agent 184.786000 193.733250 you know and so the i[dea]- idea behind that is to to you know that's why we we have higher tax rates for people who have higher income right at least suppose[dly]-
Customer 185.523375 192.488250 [silence]
Customer 192.488250 194.835875 well that's the theory um
Agent 193.733250 202.025000 you know that's what progressive tax regressive tax is you can have a flat f[lat]- percentage tax um across the board
Customer 194.835875 199.418125 [silence]
Customer 199.418125 200.528875 um-hum
Customer 200.528875 201.532875 [silence]
Customer 201.532875 202.640000 yeah
Agent 202.025000 213.865500 and e[ven]- and even tax people for things that they need to live so if you tax you can tax uh you know medicine or food and a[nd]-
Customer 202.640000 212.125750 [silence]
Customer 212.125750 224.149750 yeah well they play that game here in New York but um it worki[ng]- it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and there's a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities
Agent 213.865500 235.911875 [silence]
Customer 224.149750 235.702875 i'm sorry on[ly]- not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can [rec[oncentrated]-/concentrated] uh concentrated then it is taxed
Customer 235.702875 236.716250 [silence]
Agent 235.911875 236.783250 uh-huh
Customer 236.716250 240.028625 so um i don't claim to understand that [laughter]
Agent 236.783250 237.487125 [laughter]
Agent 237.487125 239.803500 [silence]
Agent 239.803500 241.091625 um-hum
Customer 240.028625 242.008375 you know that's um
Agent 241.091625 247.937375 [silence]
Customer 242.008375 249.992375 and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and
Agent 247.937375 248.981000 yeah
Agent 248.981000 249.982500 [silence]
Agent 249.982500 251.947125 yeah sin taxes
Customer 249.992375 251.611875 hope people -[w]ill stop
Customer 251.611875 253.268125 yeah but you know we
Agent 251.947125 257.512250 you don't need cigarettes or or um alcohol to live
Customer 253.268125 255.027000 [silence]
Customer 255.027000 263.465000 liquor yeah thing is you know you got to l[ook]- all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people [laughter]
Agent 257.512250 263.505500 [silence]
Customer 263.465000 267.237375 [silence]
Agent 263.505500 268.296250 well it's to a degree if uh you know if you're addicted it's not going to matter but
Customer 267.237375 268.554750 hm
Agent 268.296250 279.866750 um certainly it it depends i mean here you in New Jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax sort of value added tax on your utilities
Customer 268.554750 279.683875 [silence]
Customer 279.683875 280.892875 hm
Agent 279.866750 293.253000 so things you need to heat your home the things that drink your water you tax water [laughter] it's crazy um you know you you see what you it's got to go somewhere so you got tax for that every utility's thir[teen]- thirteen percent
Customer 280.892875 281.939875 [silence]
Customer 281.939875 282.913750 right
