Agent 87.412875 223.609250 [silence]
Customer 91.982125 93.147625 [silence]
Customer 93.147625 104.675750 when when gas prices are the same whether you use cash or credit i usually use my Discover card and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra
Customer 104.675750 118.315875 because_1 they pay in our credit union pays at the end of the month on your balance so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that and then i'll pay my credit cards off in full every month
Customer 118.315875 124.724750 so you know i have no finance charges as long as i pay off exactly on time which i do
Customer 124.724750 137.857375 and also Discover card gives you a little bit of money back it's not much but you know five or six bucks uh instead of writing a check for a large purchase if i'm disciplined enough i can
Customer 137.857375 146.211000 uh like we[ll]- uh like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks you know i'll get some of that back through the
Customer 146.211000 155.178125 cash back program and also at the end of the month you know i'll get my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check
Customer 155.178125 165.685125 and i do that sometimes but like when we go to the like uh i'd say it's about fifty fifty writing a check or using the Discover card
Customer 165.685125 180.557750 it just i don't know for some reason it just depe[nd]- if it's something small i don't want to write a uh use my credit card but that's the only one i have and and sometimes we order things through the mail like books and uh
Customer 180.557750 188.287375 which is i just if they have a toll free number i'll call it up and you know charge it to my credit card a[s]- as long as
Customer 188.287375 195.603250 you know i'd make myself pay on time every time so there's no finance charge and
Customer 195.603250 209.611125 it's really you know like you said some people go off half wild and spend uh they think because they've got a thousand dollar limit then you know they've got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying
Customer 209.611125 223.332750 finance charges and they just and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it
Customer 223.332750 242.043000 [silence]
Agent 223.609250 233.567250 see that's exactly i didn't get in debt but what i did was one year oh i can't remember when five six must be eight nine years ago
Agent 233.567250 241.190750 when i paid my taxes i realized that i had ran up so much on my credit card that i was paying interest that was
Agent 241.190750 245.280625 ridiculous i mean sure it was the tax write-off but
Customer 242.043000 243.030125 uh-huh
Customer 243.030125 246.541125 [silence]
Agent 245.280625 246.900750 there was no sense to it
Customer 246.541125 247.439750 yeah
Agent 246.900750 253.354625 i mean there was no sense at all to it i was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth as far as i could tell
Customer 247.439750 248.616250 [silence]
Customer 248.616250 249.346000 yeah
Customer 249.346000 267.953500 [silence]
Agent 253.354625 261.493000 so at that point there we just stepped right on you know just saving all the way in and i'll turn around like on my car i'll borrow
Agent 261.493000 266.786000 against my insurance which i pay five percent interest
Agent 266.786000 268.787750 and buy my car that way

Customer 355.056000 357.500000 so you actually see how much you're spending
Customer 357.500000 364.643125 [silence]

Agent 362.835375 368.036250 to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other

Customer 374.546625 380.419375 [silence]
Agent 377.296000 380.684250 but i'll pull it out of savings because i don't keep any balance in the checking
Customer 380.419375 381.688750 uh-huh
Agent 380.684250 387.260500 but that's still that's easy enough as it is but i wouldn't use the machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it

Agent 505.189000 522.765375 [silence]
Customer 519.467625 531.184750 it was good to have a credit card because_1 like if my car breaks down or something a [vocalized-noise] lot of states don't because i travel from Indiana to Texas and a lot of states won't take out of state checks like you know just some gas station out of the way
Agent 522.765375 524.252250 um-hum

Customer 539.757500 550.093750 plus they play pay you cash back at the end of the i think i earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which isn't very much but i'd just started to use it and
Customer 550.093750 561.697500 and like i- i had some major purchases i just was dumb and forgot to put on there like uh i wrote a check for my wife's wedding ring which was a lot of money and if i would have put it on the Discover card
Customer 561.697500 571.050875 the money you know could have sat in the savings account or the checking account for an extra month and it also would have paid me probably you know eight or nine bucks back
Customer 571.050875 580.760875 on uh the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know i'm still not in it's not a good habit to use it but fortunately i'm not uh
Customer 580.760875 590.767875 like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it
Customer 590.767875 596.363875 then i i'll use the Discover card you know to get a little more interest
Customer 596.363875 598.119875 but uh
Customer 598.119875 600.049250 yeah i i'm just very [vocalized-noise]
