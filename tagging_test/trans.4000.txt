Customer 141.406750 161.133625 [silence]
Agent 151.100500 161.700375 and uh lot of people uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not
Customer 161.133625 162.506125 [noise]
Agent 161.700375 167.233000 and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it
Customer 162.506125 166.797500 [silence]
Customer 166.797500 172.465875 [noise] we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions

Agent 173.121750 187.283500 [silence]
Customer 179.575375 187.662625 you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars

Customer 199.436250 203.388500 and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments
Agent 199.472750 209.323125 [silence]
Customer 203.388500 209.643625 so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings
Agent 209.323125 210.723875 uh-huh
Customer 209.643625 215.628250 and i- i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are a[nd]- uh
Agent 210.723875 247.493750 [silence]
Customer 215.628250 223.038500 well that's in our goals i guess for this y[ear]- first quarter is to examine our financial
Customer 223.038500 235.416625 standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh
Customer 235.416625 245.867250 [noise] oh i can't remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasn't enough difference
Customer 245.867250 259.426250 in the interest rate to make a different i mean [noise] to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um
Agent 247.493750 248.772500 right
Agent 248.772500 265.195250 [silence]
Customer 259.426250 265.760875 money money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but

Customer 265.760875 271.104125 [noise] right now i don't know what do you think the way things are going right now
Agent 266.665375 272.115625 [silence]
Customer 271.104125 272.248125 that
Agent 272.115625 282.512750 well uh um with the economy the way it is it's very important that um we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we'll need it
Customer 272.248125 281.927000 [silence]
Customer 281.927000 283.251250 right
Agent 282.512750 287.624875 and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder
Customer 283.251250 287.116750 [silence]
Customer 287.116750 288.446500 right
Agent 287.624875 298.466000 [noise] and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a person has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergenc[ies]-
Customer 288.446500 298.466000 [silence]
