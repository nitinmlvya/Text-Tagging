Agent 269.112250 272.351250 you know when he's selling them that somebody else made it i mean it's
Agent 272.351250 275.472000 so that he gets his own profits
Customer 274.281625 284.718875 yeah well the [noise] yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them_1 sell these things

Agent 299.138375 308.252375 [silence]
Customer 308.028000 314.198250 course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but you'd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldn't
