Customer 188.255875 189.439875 um-hum
Agent 188.939375 199.846250 say instead of using your credit card if you want to just go ahead and write these checks and we'll charge it'll go right against your account they they try to induce you during the Christmas season to to wrack up a few more [laughter-dollars]
