Customer 152.797875 154.399125 um-hum um-hum

Agent 179.346375 185.104250 [silence]
Agent 185.104250 193.282750 i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well
Customer 185.177000 195.708500 [silence]
Agent 193.282750 202.377125 how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash

Agent 205.400750 208.965250 [silence]
Customer 205.425625 209.813750 well and also in a sense they're giving you a loan for a month so that
Agent 208.965250 209.970375 yeah
Customer 209.813750 216.357375 you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i don't do but

Agent 214.551000 215.890000 um-hum

Agent 268.261375 276.586250 [silence]
Customer 269.229000 277.280000 i guess because i never [laughter-experienced] it and it's not because you know i'm rich or anything it's just uh a mental concept that i have

Customer 277.280000 279.886625 yeah that i just
