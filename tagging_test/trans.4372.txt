Agent 0.000000 8.740375 [noise] so let's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order
Customer 0.000000 1.048625 [noise]
Customer 1.048625 21.531625 [silence]
Agent 8.740375 19.530875 and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it
Agent 19.530875 22.845750 what do you think is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there
Customer 21.531625 32.428250 well actually i don't think they're out of line De[vil's]- Devil's advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and wheth[er]- whether or not you agree with that law
Agent 22.845750 36.690875 [silence]
Customer 32.428250 37.351875 i[t]- you're still circumventing it you are legal in in your circumvention of that law
Agent 36.690875 47.261750 what what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying um income tax on something that you purchase mail order
Customer 37.351875 47.285750 [silence]
Agent 47.261750 77.358625 [silence]
Customer 47.285750 61.350250 uh really i- i- i don't think that's a valid argument i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax um s[ome]- naturally some some things you just can't find in your local KMart or or [noise] um
Customer 61.350250 64.791250 Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but
Customer 64.791250 77.367250 th[en]- th[en]- then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax
Agent 77.358625 79.790750 well i mean it seems to me that
Customer 77.367250 89.448625 [silence]
Agent 79.790750 88.286000 generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania it's because
Agent 88.286000 100.012000 i'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uh it's because i- i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that
Customer 89.448625 90.879875 yes
Customer 90.879875 115.609500 [silence]
Agent 100.012000 107.265250 and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed
Agent 107.265250 115.741375 even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer
Customer 115.609500 119.418375 i i'll agree it it's not your responsibility but
Agent 115.741375 148.319250 [silence]
Customer 119.418375 122.720250 i[s]- b[ut]- is it also legal
Customer 122.720250 135.558750 for you to do that w[hat]- w[hat]- fr[om]- from what i understand from v[arious]- v[arious]- various net readings i[t]- i[t]- it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state
Customer 135.558750 149.083000 tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states c[an]- can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that w[ill]- do your arguments still apply
Agent 148.319250 161.681250 well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion
Customer 149.083000 173.505375 [silence]
Agent 161.681250 174.362500 then i don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need [noise] to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania
Customer 173.505375 176.632125 which is exactly what businesses do at the present
Agent 174.362500 175.996375 [silence]
Agent 175.996375 190.051125 right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer
Customer 176.632125 187.329250 [silence]
Customer 187.329250 189.017125 and i- i
Customer 189.017125 195.122875 i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it
Agent 190.051125 194.628750 [silence]
Agent 194.628750 195.941500 ah
Customer 195.122875 196.249125 [silence]
Agent 195.941500 209.907000 [silence]
Customer 196.249125 204.815000 that's my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesn't pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay
Customer 204.815000 210.581500 and there r[easons]- there are s[ome]- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that
Agent 209.907000 218.987500 uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax
Customer 210.581500 215.375375 [silence]
Customer 215.375375 217.600000 a as if
Customer 217.600000 220.560375 no businesses um if
Agent 218.987500 221.056250 or purchasing
Customer 220.560375 230.429500 purchasing things mail order if i if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards uh from from say Utah um
Agent 221.056250 244.058000 [silence]
Customer 230.429500 237.457750 i- i might buy the motherboards from Utah but then still have to pay some Pennsylvania sales tax my a[partment]- accounting department will at the end of the month
Customer 237.457750 238.639000 [silence]
Customer 238.639000 244.480750 uh i think that [noise] i think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania and i know they work that way in uh say here in DC
Agent 244.058000 249.337875 yeah see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't i never see that end of the business
Customer 244.480750 248.661250 [silence]
Customer 248.661250 250.006625 yeah
Agent 249.337875 253.801750 so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer
Customer 250.006625 272.967000 [silence]
Agent 253.801750 254.982875 [silence]
Agent 254.982875 264.719500 um but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that
Agent 264.719500 272.233000 um the opportunity f[or]- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided
Agent 272.233000 298.466000 [silence]
Customer 272.967000 286.716375 that's true i[s]- i[s]- a r[eal]- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i- i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a [noise] a a loss i- i think
Customer 286.716375 298.466000 is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism jus[t]- just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue that's being lost um and i- i don't know if i agree with that but it b[ut]-
