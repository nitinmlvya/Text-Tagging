Agent 0.000000 0.531625 [noise]
Customer 0.000000 0.272250 [noise]
Customer 0.272250 5.219375 so is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not straightforward at all
Agent 0.531625 2.637875 [silence]
Agent 2.637875 3.586750 [noise]
Agent 3.586750 15.141250 yeah actu[ally]- actually uh mine's real straightforward um basically uh you know i take my standard deductions um on my house which i have a mortgage on
Customer 5.219375 14.680250 [silence]
Customer 14.680250 15.889250 um-hum
Agent 15.141250 22.282500 and uh that's usually the big the big payoff part of the year for me because_1 i get a couple thousand dollars back usually
Customer 15.889250 21.526750 [silence]
Customer 21.526750 23.278625 oh that's nice
Agent 22.282500 29.435250 but uh actually i uh i don't really begrudge uh the uh the government their due
Customer 23.278625 37.655125 [silence]
Agent 29.435250 37.899375 i d[o]- i do think that uh probably just like just almost anybody else that you know there's a lot of inefficiency in how they distribute taxes
Customer 37.655125 38.901375 right
Agent 37.899375 45.807125 and i don't think that they uh they do a very good job of distributing them_1 to the people [laughter-who] really need them [laughter] but uh
Customer 38.901375 43.988500 [silence]
Customer 43.988500 45.195250 um-hum
Customer 45.195250 51.967000 [silence]
Agent 45.807125 51.982250 generally i think they're pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didn't have taxation [laughter-so]
Customer 51.967000 64.000375 right i don't have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i don't know if they're unfair they're confusing and i there seems to be
Agent 51.982250 67.705125 [silence]
Customer 64.000375 65.629625 less
Customer 65.629625 68.560750 ability to get those all together
Agent 67.705125 74.627750 yeah we actu[ally]- we actually had a situation here where uh our house was appraised you know every year by the county
Customer 68.560750 74.003750 [silence]
Customer 74.003750 75.313500 um-hum
Agent 74.627750 78.872250 and we have to uh pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was
Customer 75.313500 78.495250 [silence]
Customer 78.495250 79.595000 um-hum
Agent 78.872250 87.941500 and first year we owned the house um that appraisal was something like twenty five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for [laughter]
Customer 79.595000 87.001375 [silence]
Customer 87.001375 88.478250 really
Agent 87.941500 97.841250 and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization
Customer 88.478250 97.524625 [silence]
Customer 97.524625 98.795250 right
Agent 97.841250 103.648000 uh in Prince William County and make sure that you know a mistake hadn't been made and all that kind of stuff
Customer 98.795250 108.078500 [silence]
Agent 103.648000 113.098875 and so i just sort of made my case on the basis of um you know analogy to other to other houses around us that were similar in terms of
Customer 108.078500 109.991000 you just bought it right
Customer 109.991000 119.088750 [silence]
Agent 113.098875 125.657375 square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and ju[st]- just showed that you know our obvi[ous]- for some reason our property had been valued much higher
Customer 119.088750 120.379500 right
Customer 120.379500 129.391875 [silence]
Agent 125.657375 131.177500 and uh they bought it they actually reduced the uh reduced the a[ppraisal]-
Customer 129.391875 132.872625 really they didn't raise the they c[anceled]- your neighbors' taxes
Agent 131.177500 132.402375 [silence]
Agent 132.402375 140.632750 uh they didn't raise my neighbors' [laughter-yeah] they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal
Customer 132.872625 140.227000 [silence]
Customer 140.227000 141.632875 that's really great
Agent 140.632750 149.276875 so i y[ou]- you know i I realized well the you know few instances you can fight city hall on things like property taxes but uh
Customer 141.632875 148.467375 [silence]
Customer 148.467375 150.296125 that's wonderful
Agent 149.276875 159.846375 yeah it was it was an interesting experience because the guy before me went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion you know i mean he was sort of
Customer 150.296125 162.382625 [silence]
Agent 159.846375 168.004750 mad at the world and [laughter-uh] [laughter-he] he had sort of tha[t]- that mad at the world attitude right off the bat which you could you know see a mile away
Customer 162.382625 163.441375 right
Customer 163.441375 167.497250 [silence]
Customer 167.497250 168.704500 um-hum
Agent 168.004750 180.000250 and then he uh then he started talking about all the things that were wrong with this property you know like you know the leaves hadn't been cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and you know a lot of really minor stuff
Customer 168.704500 179.656375 [silence]
Customer 179.656375 180.927125 right
Agent 180.000250 184.721125 that just didn't impress these guys at all and they sort of gave him a hard time
Customer 180.927125 182.414125 [silence]
Customer 182.414125 183.663125 [laughter]
Customer 183.663125 194.609375 [silence]
Agent 184.721125 195.251875 but uh you know when i pointed out that that our house was appraised at this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at you know twenty five thousand dollars less i mean
Customer 194.609375 197.985875 right and you just bought yours that's the best argument i think
Agent 195.251875 196.906875 [silence]
Agent 196.906875 205.185500 yeah so it it it worked it was actually pretty uh pretty sa[tisfying]- satisfying [laughter] experience [laughter]
Customer 197.985875 203.647500 [silence]
Customer 203.647500 205.409875 that's wonderful
Agent 205.185500 214.428750 but it wa[s]- it was kind of like going up to the Pope though you know i mean they they uh were sitting in these you know at these giant judges tables you know like

Agent 219.878500 221.268750 [silence]
Agent 221.268750 233.389000 it was the it was the county but it wasn't the council they have different people on this Board of Equalization i don't know i don't even know how they get on it you know i i'm just guessing they're appointed
Customer 221.766375 232.794125 [silence]
Customer 232.794125 234.020875 um-hum
Agent 233.389000 242.812750 uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here [laughter-so] you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time it'd be him [laughter-you]
