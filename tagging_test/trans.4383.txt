Agent 198.913750 205.907500 [silence]
Customer 203.392375 206.376125 those kinds of things and we don't even do that
Agent 205.907500 212.995250 no i- i don't even think uh participation would have [vocalized-noise] as far as democrats and republicans go it'd have to be a third party
Customer 206.376125 207.865125 [vocalized-noise]
Customer 207.865125 213.001000 [silence]

Customer 213.001000 219.882125 oh still i mean we have the right to do it we don't do it that's the whole problem we don't exercise those rights
Customer 219.882125 225.082125 i don't know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean
Customer 225.082125 226.657750 um
Customer 226.657750 232.096000 that would definitely cut down on the consumerism [vocalized-noise] and which really pushes
Customer 232.096000 233.096875 [silence]
Customer 233.096875 245.536875 a lot of the uh you know it'd be a good way of getting revenues and all so bring in line towards savings and and putting money into uh instead of spending into investment
Customer 245.536875 247.857750 [silence]
Agent 246.722500 247.986250 um

Agent 256.863500 270.234000 [silence]
Customer 257.358250 264.329000 well i don't know i think if people put their minds to it they can do it it's just a matter of mobilizing
Customer 264.329000 271.134000 uh you know the people that do it it's a very difficult task i'm not saying that any of this is easy [laughter]
Agent 270.234000 275.396250 you know we're we're talking about numbers that i can't even comprehend
Customer 271.134000 275.446000 [silence]

Customer 275.446000 276.855875 yeah
Customer 276.855875 278.039125 [silence]
Customer 278.039125 289.855750 well think about the wars the nuclear situation and all that talking about the numbers of atomic bombs and how many times you can bomb the world over and how incredible that was and now
Agent 278.582000 297.762000 [silence]
Customer 289.855750 294.764375 y[ou]- you know that's coming to a point where that's less li[kely]- less and less likely
