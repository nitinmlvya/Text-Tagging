Customer 47.965125 50.409375 oh maybe they're going to arrest us both
Agent 48.455875 49.499000 [silence]
Agent 49.499000 52.955125 i'm even even in worse shape because_1 i have eight children
Customer 50.409375 63.860625 [silence]
Agent 52.955125 62.850375 and uh we live from hand to [laughter-mouth] we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we [laughter-try] [laughter-to] [laughter] due for the next month
Agent 62.850375 63.890000 [silence]
Customer 63.860625 65.247625 wow
Agent 63.890000 69.569750 a cou[ple]- a couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but i'm not disciplined enough
Customer 65.247625 70.941125 [silence]
Agent 69.569750 71.589125 to keep doing it
Customer 70.941125 72.239750 uh-huh
Agent 71.589125 79.907250 the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes
Customer 72.239750 79.630375 [silence]
Customer 79.630375 81.032750 yeah
Agent 79.907250 88.423125 and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the envelope was empty [laughter] then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area
Customer 81.032750 87.591625 [silence]
Customer 87.591625 88.925250 uh-huh
Agent 88.423125 93.184625 and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
Customer 88.925250 92.579875 [silence]
Customer 92.579875 93.809375 uh-huh
Agent 93.184625 97.186125 it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money
Customer 93.809375 109.326625 [silence]
Agent 97.186125 109.879125 and we did that pretty successfully for about three months [laughter-and] then we [laughter-started] [laughter-borrowing] [laughter-from] [laughter-one] [laughter-envelope] [laughter-to] [laughter] [laughter-put] it in the [laughter-other] envelope and [laughter] in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do
Customer 109.326625 119.145625 huh the um i had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six
Agent 109.879125 139.705125 [silence]
Customer 119.145625 120.659500 and uh
Customer 120.659500 134.186625 uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that and i actually did my bank account would uh i had i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month
Customer 134.186625 144.654625 but i i had miscalculated i well i didn't keep a balance [laughter] it's one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary
Agent 139.705125 140.989875 [laughter]
Agent 140.989875 160.544875 [silence]
Customer 144.654625 149.259375 even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes would just things would get to tight
Customer 149.259375 154.376000 uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
Customer 154.376000 166.615125 and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning
Agent 160.544875 161.824625 uh-huh
Agent 161.824625 166.094750 [silence]
Agent 166.094750 167.380625 uh-huh
Customer 166.615125 178.092375 but i would forget to write the things down and i[t]- it that i i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not [laughter] i[n]- in keeping that kind of data i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever
Agent 167.380625 177.017500 [silence]
Agent 177.017500 184.213000 i even find now like with the automatic tellers i'll go take money out of that and then i forget to take that out of my [laughter-checking] account
Customer 178.092375 180.294500 [silence]
Customer 180.294500 181.545625 yeah
Customer 181.545625 183.111000 [silence]
Customer 183.111000 184.517750 uh-huh
Agent 184.213000 185.806125 and uh
Customer 184.517750 185.835875 yeah
Agent 185.806125 190.118250 so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account
Customer 185.835875 194.949125 [silence]
Agent 190.118250 195.720625 and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
Customer 194.949125 196.231750 uh-huh
Agent 195.720625 200.527750 and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make
Customer 196.231750 199.755625 [silence]
Customer 199.755625 201.123875 uh-huh
Agent 200.527750 233.106875 [silence]
Customer 201.123875 211.082500 the uh i i- i have to say that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money um and it uh
Customer 211.082500 217.411375 a[nd]- and i don't i mean someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i don't have
Customer 217.411375 226.434625 and i i i i think my strategy if if i may i[s]- i[s]- is is to is to not spend money i mean i don't have expensive tastes
Customer 226.434625 238.186250 i don't go out i mean i buy a car well the last car i got rid of i'd had it was nineteen years old pe[ople]- people were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car and
Agent 233.106875 234.736625 yeah
Agent 234.736625 236.740625 [laughter]
Agent 236.740625 238.728000 it was still running
Customer 238.186250 243.459250 oh it was great my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty five Buick and it just wouldn't stop
Agent 238.728000 247.852875 [silence]
Customer 243.459250 248.518250 um and it i i just didn't feel the need for a new car it isn't like i couldn't afford one
Agent 247.852875 249.133000 uh-huh
Customer 248.518250 252.405125 uh and now i mean i i don't uh
Agent 249.133000 262.695500 [silence]
Customer 252.405125 257.825000 i tend to eat expensive food i mean i don't mind buying a good steak but for me
Customer 257.825000 263.153500 i only do that every week or um without even i mean maybe once a month
Agent 262.695500 263.906000 yeah
Customer 263.153500 274.805375 i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that
Agent 263.906000 273.980500 [silence]
Agent 273.980500 276.283625 [laughter] not very often
Customer 274.805375 288.899125 but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to
Agent 276.283625 288.065250 [silence]
Agent 288.065250 289.354250 that's right
Customer 288.899125 300.226000 so so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need to budget is that i don't have i don't i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because_1 i can't afford it because i'm not interested in that expensive thing
Agent 289.354250 299.580000 [silence]
Agent 299.580000 300.226000 [vocalized-noise]
