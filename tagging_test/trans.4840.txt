Customer 98.779000 100.211625 um-hum
Agent 99.217125 105.546875 you know it's it's becoming a a large responsibility but s[omeone]- someone has to pay for it and that's us

Customer 119.367875 127.233625 i think it's one of the local news i think they're having an a documentary something about that about they're trying to catch some people about

Agent 134.479125 137.783000 [silence]
Agent 137.783000 150.575250 yeah and and even even today it's like you know there's still a considerable amount of taxes that you know we're paying for but you'd think that we're still in thi[s]- this this uh deficit state that we're still not able to pay off things just because
Customer 138.037500 149.999375 [silence]
Customer 149.999375 151.506625 i [laughter-know]

Customer 152.641250 154.013750 yeah
Agent 153.408500 161.169375 and makes you wonder when there's [vocalized-noise] you know uh countries out there that have you know tax rates also like close to fifty percent or higher
Customer 154.013750 160.489875 [silence]
Customer 160.489875 162.028875 um-hum
Agent 161.169375 169.363125 you know it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you can get it and that that's kind of a scary thought and i hope it doesn't come down to that
Customer 162.028875 164.943250 [silence]
Customer 164.943250 166.395875 um-hum

Customer 169.558500 172.317875 yeah [laughter]
Agent 171.006750 181.751000 but on the other hand they also whi[le]- while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it
Customer 172.317875 187.707625 [silence]
Agent 181.751000 192.558000 so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and it's good but it's it's the price they pay [laughter]
Customer 187.707625 189.064000 um-hum
Customer 189.064000 191.414375 [silence]
Customer 191.414375 192.797250 yeah
Agent 192.558000 205.081000 i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because tho[se]- those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot
Customer 192.797250 208.366875 [silence]
Agent 205.081000 211.591500 um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't try and generate a larger um

Customer 209.714375 218.620250 [silence]

Customer 224.687500 226.974250 yeah yeah
Agent 226.143375 235.292375 as i[t]- as it turns out you know it's one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because_1 well it's nice to know that when i'm actually you know i do start working that

Agent 247.316875 253.015750 [silence]
Agent 253.015750 265.565375 i think in a in a way it's good in a way it's not um but i think in general it's probably good i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past
Customer 253.593875 262.685250 [silence]
Customer 262.685250 264.001750 um-hum
Customer 264.001750 270.137875 [silence]
Agent 265.565375 274.145500 um have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them you know sponsored by alcohol and tobacco companies
Customer 270.137875 271.481375 um-hum
Customer 271.481375 273.234875 [silence]
Customer 273.234875 274.589250 um-hum
Agent 274.145500 283.191000 and it's things like tobacco are um they're they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers

Customer 280.603000 282.380500 yeah
Customer 282.380500 284.000000 right
Agent 283.191000 292.608500 and it's as far as a safety thing in like in San Luis Obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that um there's no smoking in any public areas
Customer 284.000000 297.132125 [silence]
Agent 292.608500 297.640875 and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
