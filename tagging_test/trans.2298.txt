Agent 31.470750 33.566000 the major or a good portion of it
Customer 33.504875 44.206250 no argument here yeah i- i think that uh now i'm i'm no financial expert but from what i've read and heard
Agent 33.566000 43.365250 [silence]
Agent 43.365250 44.615750 that makes two of us

Agent 44.615750 45.572375 [laughter]
Agent 45.572375 79.159250 [silence]
Customer 54.526000 56.817375 uh riskier
Customer 56.817375 71.795000 uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oi[l]- when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that
Customer 71.795000 79.552750 without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down
Agent 79.159250 83.897500 yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the [noise]
Customer 79.552750 85.746750 [silence]
Agent 83.897500 88.319750 the major culprit um with the oil crisis
Customer 85.746750 95.350625 well also in in[vestments]- investments in oil ventures as well because it was predic[ted]- predicated on uh a certain price per barrel
Agent 88.319750 89.405500 [silence]
Agent 89.405500 90.664625 right
Agent 90.664625 105.790875 [silence]
Customer 95.350625 102.066625 to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to
Customer 102.066625 105.977750 twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even
Agent 105.790875 108.027125 yeah i guess that was the immediate cause
Customer 105.977750 107.728125 [silence]
Customer 107.728125 109.027250 yeah

Customer 126.137250 128.734250 yeah yeah
Agent 127.242500 132.306500 i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum
Customer 128.734250 132.638125 [silence]
Agent 132.306500 135.393875 and on the other hand i don't

Customer 186.483750 195.402000 i'm not sure which which one is which i- i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse
Agent 194.404875 195.947125 [laughter]
Customer 195.402000 206.067000 [silence]
Agent 195.947125 206.957500 yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them_1 out of it
Customer 206.067000 215.542750 yeah now i i'm a staunch Republican but uh you know for the last nine years i've heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt

Agent 231.209125 233.153875 they got a little uh
Agent 233.153875 241.652625 a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time
Customer 241.219000 245.324125 yeah i think ending the the Gulf War quickly was beneficial

Customer 269.445500 279.836125 [silence]
Agent 270.106750 274.086000 it seems to me like they really haven't uh at least they haven't
Agent 274.086000 283.352875 if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh uh not out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh
