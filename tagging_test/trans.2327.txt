Agent 0.000000 7.136875 [silence]
Customer 0.000000 1.364500 [noise]
Customer 1.364500 6.963125 okay what is your uh general opinion then of of taxes for the Americans
Customer 6.963125 12.098000 [silence]
Agent 7.136875 8.421000 um
Agent 8.421000 12.717000 i don't think that i'm paying too many tax you know too much tax myself
Customer 12.098000 13.403000 yeah
Agent 12.717000 22.100750 uh i uh as far as uh you know federal and state uh the uh the state i live in has a five percent sales tax
Customer 13.403000 21.352375 [silence]
Customer 21.352375 22.781500 um-hum
Agent 22.100750 27.704250 uh it's quite a bit different than uh Texas i don't know if you've ever been outside of Texas but uh
Customer 22.781500 37.015375 [silence]
Agent 27.704250 38.202125 when i moved to Texas i was told oh well there's no personal income tax well they nail you on property taxes in uh Texas and then that's how they get their money to take care of the schools and things
Customer 37.015375 39.526000 right yeah uh
Agent 38.202125 62.374875 [silence]
Customer 39.526000 45.428000 as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not
Customer 45.428000 58.769125 they're not equitable within the state so they're changing that they're talking about changing the uh the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools which will probably mean uh another increase in property taxes
Customer 58.769125 62.763875 either that or uh starting a state income tax
Agent 62.374875 75.557500 yeah i- i found it interesting uh when i moved to Texas the fact that uh the reason people wanted to get their kids into Plano was to go to the Plano school district because_1 it was the best because it had more money than you know other places
Customer 62.763875 87.597000 [silence]
Agent 75.557500 77.836875 and uh i just um
Agent 77.836875 90.728375 in the uh like here in Maryland uh i just bought a uh a house for a hundred and forty one thousand it'd be about sixty thousand down there [laughter] and um
Customer 87.597000 89.602625 [laughter]
Customer 89.602625 96.566375 [silence]
Agent 90.728375 97.417000 the tax basis is actually uh less than the full price of the house
Customer 96.566375 97.993375 uh-huh
Agent 97.417000 103.139250 so you end up paying property taxes on what they value the house at i think they only have the house valued at probably about
Customer 97.993375 104.873750 [silence]
Agent 103.139250 105.943875 [noise] ninety or a hundred thousand dollars
Customer 104.873750 106.234875 yeah
Agent 105.943875 113.407125 whereas when i was in Texas i notice that they put the tax basis at at almost the uh full price
Customer 106.234875 111.105375 [silence]
Customer 111.105375 113.882125 almost full value right yeah
Agent 113.407125 115.663250 and so there was quite a difference there
Customer 113.882125 114.925750 [silence]
Customer 114.925750 116.168125 yeah
Agent 115.663250 122.780125 um i think that the way they they levy taxes is a little bit uh
Customer 116.168125 136.732500 [silence]
Agent 122.780125 131.977375 crazy i think if if they uh people and and i'll use Plano as an example uh house prices in Plano were falling
Agent 131.977375 144.671000 and so they decided well in order to get more tax revenue we're going to have to raise the price uh you know we're going to have to raise the uh the the uh tax per hundred dollars of value on the house
Customer 136.732500 138.279500 um-hum
Customer 138.279500 159.473375 [silence]
Agent 144.671000 152.426375 and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes
Agent 152.426375 166.593125 then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people weren't buying the existing family homes so
Customer 159.473375 160.847625 right
Customer 160.847625 165.524125 [silence]
Customer 165.524125 166.733125 right
Agent 166.593125 168.549375 they were shooting themselves in the foot
Customer 166.733125 168.180000 [silence]
Customer 168.180000 169.713625 [laughter]
Agent 168.549375 175.110875 and you know if they just would have thought well gee if we don't you know if we put a freeze on new home starts
Customer 169.713625 185.632750 [silence]
Agent 175.110875 186.239125 that will bring the price of houses back up our tax base revenue will go up and we won't have to increase taxes and make it more of a burden on people that are living here
Customer 185.632750 188.023875 yeah guess that's a possibility
Agent 186.239125 192.744000 [silence]
Customer 188.023875 194.394000 uh as i understand it Maryland does not have any uh state income tax is that right
Agent 192.744000 196.167125 no no they do have state income tax
Customer 194.394000 195.519750 [silence]
Customer 195.519750 197.501125 oh okay so
Agent 196.167125 210.746750 yeah that's and they uh they divide it up by um you know you pay a state income tax and then fifty percent of your state income tax is a county tax which is collected by the state and redistributed to the counties
Customer 197.501125 209.481500 [silence]
Customer 209.481500 216.673375 okay then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes
Agent 210.746750 215.922875 [silence]
Agent 215.922875 217.711750 that is correct
Customer 216.673375 225.494125 okay did you live in Texas after the uh after they stopped letting you deduct uh sales tax on your tax return
Agent 217.711750 224.959750 [silence]
Agent 224.959750 231.862875 um yes i did i only lived in Texas in eighty seven and um eighty eight and uh part of eighty nine
Customer 225.494125 231.069375 [silence]
Customer 231.069375 236.316875 okay so so you couldn't deduct state inco[me]- uh state sales tax when you lived in Texas
Agent 231.862875 235.695375 [silence]
Agent 235.695375 237.085375 no
Customer 236.316875 240.328500 so what do you think about the difference between those two situations
Agent 237.085375 240.368500 [silence]
Customer 240.328500 249.223750 [silence]
Agent 240.368500 242.092500 um
Agent 242.092500 249.768750 in Texas i was oh i believe the uh t[ax]- sales tax was somewhere around seven eight eight percent
Customer 249.223750 250.291625 um-hum
Agent 249.768750 258.879500 here in Maryland it's only five um it was nice to have that uh you know deduction when it was available
Customer 250.291625 256.793125 [silence]
Customer 256.793125 257.908500 yeah
Customer 257.908500 283.753375 [silence]
Agent 258.879500 265.211125 uh but when they revamped the you know supposedly making things more fair um
Agent 265.211125 273.500375 i've heard a lot of different arguments uh pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales tax or even uh
Agent 273.500375 284.470375 maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when you think about it the people that purchase more items are the ones that are better able to pay the taxes
Customer 283.753375 284.932250 right
Agent 284.470375 291.761125 you know people that are out there barely struggling to pay their uh house payment and buy food aren't going to be out buying you know anything else
Customer 284.932250 320.152875 [silence]
Agent 291.761125 296.165375 and the the people that you know have the uh disposable income that are
Agent 296.165375 299.771875 probably more able to pay the income tax
Agent 299.771875 309.613625 uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and they're out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um
Agent 309.613625 317.048125 there wa[s]- there's another crazy thing that gets me it's like the more children you have the less tax you pay
Agent 317.048125 329.644000 and to me that is completely crazy and i have five children so i mean you know i uh i you know it it's kind of odd when i talk about this with other people because it it just doesn't make sense to me you're getting more services
Customer 320.152875 321.914375 yeah [laughter]
Customer 321.914375 323.001000 yeah
Customer 323.001000 329.231750 [silence]
Customer 329.231750 330.807750 um-hum
Agent 329.644000 343.319750 you know your children are going you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense
Customer 330.807750 341.906750 [silence]
Customer 341.906750 349.740500 yeah that's that's an interesting uh interesting concept i hadn't thought about that how you you you know that that's right i guess [laughter] in a sense
Agent 343.319750 362.119250 [silence]
Customer 349.740500 360.172000 i guess the you know the idea is that uh the more people you have in the family the more allowances you need you know the more uh capability you need to uh to
Customer 360.172000 366.210250 pay for food and clothing and stuff for them so the they give you more allowances more dependent allowances for that
Agent 362.119250 363.378125 um-hum
Agent 363.378125 370.033000 [silence]
Customer 366.210250 370.448500 but uh you know i understand what you're where you're coming from with the
Agent 370.033000 377.187125 yeah now the other side of the question is about are we getting what we're paying for um
Customer 370.448500 388.664250 [silence]
Agent 377.187125 385.497250 for the most part i think we are but there is a lot of inefficiency uh both on the federal level and on the state level
Agent 385.497250 388.062625 and uh hopefully we'll
Agent 388.062625 394.807000 you know as we start to go into computerization and all the processes maybe we'll be able to streamline it
Customer 388.664250 389.913625 yeah
Customer 389.913625 400.697750 [silence]
Agent 394.807000 401.004125 um i haven't kept up with uh the Texas politics other than that dirty little uh governor fight
Customer 400.697750 401.823250 yeah
Agent 401.004125 410.651625 but i mean uh we have a a governor here in Maryland who's uh pretty hard nosed and uh he's you know we're three hundred fifty million dollars short
Customer 401.823250 416.037250 [silence]
Agent 410.651625 416.553625 and every time he comes up with a plan to cut the money everybody starts screaming and yelling
Customer 416.037250 417.285250 um-hum
Agent 416.553625 430.186750 and uh every time he wants to cut one budget or do something else or try to do something you know they start screaming yelling they won't let him raise the taxes and and they they won't let him cut any programs and he's like what do you guys want me to do
Customer 417.285250 427.506500 [silence]
Customer 427.506500 428.660125 right
Customer 428.660125 429.673750 [silence]
Customer 429.673750 430.671250 [laughter]
Agent 430.186750 432.106375 [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]
Customer 430.671250 442.044125 yeah that's i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh is we're we're talking about having uh national uh military or or public service deal for young people
Agent 432.106375 441.615750 [silence]
Agent 441.615750 442.918750 um-hum
Customer 442.044125 448.276375 maybe a program like that could replace some of the uh welfare programs
Agent 442.918750 463.385125 [silence]
Customer 448.276375 457.835125 if uh you know if we're going to do that then we ought to really get some benefit dollar benefits out of it that uh to reduce spending in some other areas uh
Customer 457.835125 463.871375 you know to do something to eliminate what uh what they refer to as transfer payments
Agent 463.385125 464.816500 yes
Customer 463.871375 476.084125 because uh that's i think that's where our real you know the real problem with government is not is not what the not what the government's doing but where it's spending its money it's it's encouraging people to
Agent 464.816500 497.828875 [silence]
Customer 476.084125 477.624500 to uh
Customer 477.624500 482.666375 not do as well as they can you know uh not have as much output and
Customer 482.666375 491.362375 all that you're paying people not to work and you're paying people to have more kids and you know like you said you know more kids you have the more dependents you have you know the allowances you get
Customer 491.362375 493.036250 and uh
Customer 493.036250 499.924000 the more you have the more uh aid for dependent children you can get and all of these things go into it so
Agent 497.828875 499.077125 yeah
Agent 499.077125 509.040750 [silence]
Customer 499.924000 509.501000 but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so
Agent 509.040750 522.602875 yeah that and i think uh putting more emphasis on local handling of the problem i think this is something that that Bush came out and said in his uh in his address uh to the nation at the beginning of the year
Customer 509.501000 521.856000 [silence]
Customer 521.856000 523.204375 right
Agent 522.602875 527.374250 um you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own
Customer 523.204375 532.390500 [silence]
Agent 527.374250 533.650375 and that you know the states would take care of the communities and then all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government
Customer 532.390500 534.209500 right it uh
Agent 533.650375 544.592625 and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know there's a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way
Customer 534.209500 543.883000 [silence]
Customer 543.883000 545.170750 right
Agent 544.592625 549.502500 and uh maintenance and overhead and you know and and those kind of costs
Customer 545.170750 547.560375 [silence]
Customer 547.560375 559.207000 yeah right i- i think that a a big part of the uh you know the government concept over the last fifty years has been uh redistribution of uh of wealth in in effect
Agent 549.502500 558.682375 [silence]
Agent 558.682375 560.013250 um-hum
Customer 559.207000 566.365375 uh you know you you tax the people that have the most and the people that don't have anything get it for nothing
Agent 560.013250 566.077250 [silence]
Agent 566.077250 567.356125 yeah
Customer 566.365375 571.632625 and uh and i don't think that's the American way myself it uh
Agent 567.356125 571.897750 [silence]
Customer 571.632625 574.694250 it kind of rings of you know socialism and
Agent 571.897750 573.128750 yeah
Agent 573.128750 589.915375 [silence]
Customer 574.694250 577.743375 and i just i don't understand why
Customer 577.743375 582.770000 the American leaders uh seem to think that that's the way to go you know that
Customer 582.770000 590.050750 uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for
Agent 589.915375 591.179500 yeah
Customer 590.050750 594.832875 or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to
Agent 591.179500 594.508250 [silence]
Agent 594.508250 600.918750 yeah there there's uh you know once you reach a certain plateau in in finances um
Customer 594.832875 600.918750 [silence]
