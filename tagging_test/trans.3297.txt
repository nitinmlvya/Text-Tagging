Customer 34.699500 38.172750 [laughter-oh] me [laughter-too]
Agent 37.037125 44.590750 but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need

Customer 43.642250 45.279625 uh-huh
Agent 44.590750 53.930625 and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging
Customer 45.279625 52.813875 [silence]
Customer 52.813875 54.367250 um-hum
Agent 53.930625 64.105250 but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy
Customer 54.367250 62.951750 [silence]
Customer 62.951750 64.527875 um-hum
Agent 64.105250 67.902125 and i'm not paying the high interest rates
Customer 64.527875 66.945875 [silence]
Customer 66.945875 69.885375 that's what kills you on those credit cards
Agent 67.902125 69.297875 [silence]
Agent 69.297875 78.138000 because it's so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well i'll just pay off the whole balance and then i won't owe any
Customer 69.885375 77.231500 [silence]
Customer 77.231500 78.858875 uh-huh
Agent 78.138000 85.632375 and then something comes up you know and well i'll just pay the minimum well you just do that forever

Customer 82.714375 84.543125 um-hum
Customer 84.543125 93.874750 oh and and with the interest charge on the credit cards you're not getting anywhere because you're paying your interest every month and that's all you're doing
Agent 85.632375 89.778000 [silence]
Agent 89.778000 92.001750 no you're paying interest
Agent 92.001750 105.926125 [silence]
Customer 93.874750 102.352250 and with our Visa that's really high interest we're in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards
Customer 102.352250 105.044750 so that somehow we can get ahead on that
Customer 105.044750 106.143250 but
Agent 105.926125 114.508875 you know i've i've thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days
Customer 106.143250 110.276125 [silence]
Customer 110.276125 111.673625 yes

Agent 126.066750 129.276250 like i say it was so convenient
Agent 129.276250 133.414000 and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan
Customer 132.798125 134.280000 um-hum
Agent 133.414000 138.626500 to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card

Customer 156.063875 157.654750 um-hum
