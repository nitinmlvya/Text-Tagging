Agent 100.096875 101.709000 um-hum
Customer 100.641625 111.110125 and it's gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point

Customer 118.882875 127.559125 i think that would be an excellent [laughter-idea] and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day
Agent 120.394625 121.806625 well
Agent 121.806625 128.680625 [silence]

Agent 195.284250 199.094250 oh it's probably what the first guy who did it called it
Customer 196.311500 198.619000 [silence]
Customer 198.619000 199.876875 cafeteria
Agent 199.094250 202.955000 yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of [laughter-it]
Customer 199.876875 201.857750 [silence]
Customer 201.857750 204.967875 [laughter]
Agent 202.955000 205.763125 [laughter]

Agent 209.119625 211.021875 i'll tell you what we could do
Customer 210.334750 211.905375 what
Agent 211.021875 214.550500 we could prohibit people from being hired that are
Customer 211.905375 221.670625 [silence]
Agent 214.550500 218.766125 historically going to cost the company money
Agent 218.766125 222.332375 you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired
Customer 221.670625 223.014500 um-hum
Agent 222.332375 225.652125 because you know i[f]-

Customer 226.536250 233.694000 [silence]
Agent 230.052000 234.306500 see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
Customer 233.694000 235.027000 yeah
Agent 234.306500 242.990125 okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company
Customer 235.027000 250.981750 [silence]
Agent 242.990125 246.850875 and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find
Agent 246.850875 250.711625 a a place to put them_1 or b you know boot them_1 out
Agent 250.711625 255.709250 [silence]
Customer 250.981750 255.252125 well that's easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching
Customer 255.252125 260.459000 [silence]
Agent 255.709250 259.774750 well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid
Agent 259.774750 262.198125 [silence]
Customer 260.459000 261.708875 thank you [noise]

Agent 265.939500 267.552000 i'm i'm
Customer 266.905125 270.232750 but it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good
Agent 267.552000 269.631375 [silence]
Agent 269.631375 270.914000 i know
Customer 270.232750 271.872750 it's almost impossible
Agent 270.914000 272.197500 [silence]
Customer 271.872750 279.808375 [silence]
Agent 272.197500 280.192375 well there's two schools of thought on that you know i i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor

Agent 280.192375 284.014375 i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that
Customer 281.112250 283.318250 [silence]
Customer 283.318250 284.635500 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 284.014375 285.432125 but
Customer 284.635500 289.137500 [silence]
Agent 285.432125 290.018625 once you get that job with the university then you've got ten years of probation
Customer 289.137500 291.157500 uh-huh
Agent 290.018625 292.374750 then you have tenure
Customer 291.157500 293.306625 [silence]
Agent 292.374750 294.504250 and they can't fire you
Customer 293.306625 295.061125 um-hum
Agent 294.504250 302.848250 well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry
Customer 295.061125 302.470500 [silence]
Customer 302.470500 303.969500 right
Agent 302.848250 307.046875 and i've also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs
Customer 303.969500 307.592375 [silence]
Agent 307.046875 314.388625 [silence]
Customer 307.592375 311.213000 well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago
Customer 311.213000 313.285000 you know f[or]- in the public schools
Customer 313.285000 314.890875 [silence]
Agent 314.388625 316.087000 but in addition
Customer 314.890875 323.028250 it made you ea[se]- more at ease you know you knew you weren't going to lose your [laughter-job] unless you really did something horrendous
Agent 316.087000 317.521125 um-hum
Agent 317.521125 322.047375 [silence]
Agent 322.047375 329.129500 well they they really can't fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the government's taken care of that
Customer 323.028250 337.409000 [silence]
Agent 329.129500 332.787375 but uh what i'm looking at is
Agent 332.787375 334.474750 you know
Agent 334.474750 342.847000 there are a lot of teachers out there that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors
Customer 337.409000 342.108500 [noise]
Customer 342.108500 343.198625 [noise] right
Agent 342.847000 347.998500 you know and i could see a point protecting someone's position
Customer 343.198625 356.800125 [silence]
Agent 347.998500 356.465250 but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all
Agent 356.465250 358.730125 [silence]
Customer 356.800125 358.323250 well they don't
Customer 358.323250 359.991750 [silence]
Agent 358.730125 359.876125 well
Agent 359.876125 361.234500 [silence]
Customer 359.991750 361.883875 in some places they don't
Agent 361.234500 366.489750 in some places they don't but you know you you've got specialized education now
Customer 361.883875 363.031750 do they
Customer 363.031750 398.162125 [silence]
Agent 366.489750 369.415875 for instance take computer science
Agent 369.415875 373.345750 you know we've got kids twenty years old
Agent 373.345750 376.899000 right now that could beat any computer
Agent 376.899000 382.258750 professor at microcomputer applications i know we do
Agent 382.258750 388.233500 and these people can't even get jobs doing anything [vocalized-noise] besides digging ditches
Agent 388.233500 393.070500 because there's no comprehensive test that they can take
Agent 393.070500 399.111375 that would allow them to s[tep]- to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
Customer 398.162125 399.649500 you know
Agent 399.111375 407.312750 you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i [laughter-mean]
Customer 399.649500 406.492625 [silence]
Customer 406.492625 408.657875 yeah [laughter]
Agent 407.312750 408.400875 [laughter]
Agent 408.400875 410.819250 i mean my agree is absolutely worthless
Customer 408.657875 418.248250 [silence]
Agent 410.819250 418.052000 it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards
Agent 418.052000 420.005000 [silence]
Customer 418.248250 420.401000 what did you get your degree in
Agent 420.005000 421.816500 Industrial Marketing
Customer 420.401000 422.081875 [silence]

Agent 427.907250 430.991750 but the two are mutually exclusive
Agent 430.991750 433.464375 because the
Agent 433.464375 439.620750 it's experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college
Customer 439.352875 440.756000 huh
Agent 439.620750 441.631625 not my degree
Customer 440.756000 446.192250 [silence]
Agent 441.631625 444.135250 which is i think kind of {bizzaro}
Agent 444.135250 452.460625 [silence]
Customer 446.192250 447.650000 maybe
Customer 447.650000 449.882375 all right what else could we change

Agent 479.359125 481.705625 well yeah
Agent 481.705625 485.180500 supervisor evaluation's always been a tough one
Agent 485.180500 488.520500 especially in my line because
Agent 488.520500 493.637000 you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check
Agent 493.637000 495.383750 [laughter]

Agent 509.286375 510.777875 you know i mean
Agent 510.777875 514.754500 uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero
Agent 514.754500 516.783250 i run the whole show
