Customer 13.009500 19.460375 [silence]
Customer 19.460375 20.918875 uh-huh
Agent 20.226000 25.207500 but it's it's not really a large organization but uh n[early]- nearly five hundred people
Customer 20.918875 22.030125 [silence]
Customer 22.030125 23.252500 uh-huh
Customer 23.252500 25.149500 [silence]
Customer 25.149500 27.678250 oh yeah that's pretty [laughter-big]
Agent 25.207500 26.299375 [vocalized-noise]
Agent 26.299375 28.199250 yeah how about_1 yourself are you
Customer 27.678250 33.617875 i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees
Agent 28.199250 29.621250 [silence]
Agent 29.621250 30.689125 that's
Agent 30.689125 32.494000 [silence]
Agent 32.494000 33.822750 uh-huh
Customer 33.617875 39.308750 i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um
Agent 33.822750 46.210250 [silence]
Customer 39.308750 50.097375 besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss
Agent 46.210250 47.595500 hum
Agent 47.595500 50.666625 yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh
Customer 50.097375 57.190250 yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one
Agent 50.666625 56.676500 [silence]
Agent 56.676500 63.252875 ooh yeah i i think it it's pro[bably]- the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um ye[ah]-
Customer 57.190250 60.847750 [silence]
Customer 60.847750 63.678375 right everyone's so integral
Agent 63.252875 66.504625 yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's
Customer 63.678375 67.615000 [silence]
Agent 66.504625 68.528000 it's generally important
Customer 67.615000 79.175375 um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too
Agent 68.528000 69.856625 but
Agent 69.856625 73.905125 [silence]
Agent 73.905125 75.683750 um um-hum
Agent 75.683750 77.985000 [silence]
Agent 77.985000 84.207625 what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things
Customer 79.175375 83.860500 [silence]
Customer 83.860500 91.302875 well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you kn[ow]- in a larger
Agent 84.207625 86.647875 [silence]
Agent 86.647875 87.980875 yeah
Agent 87.980875 89.568125 [silence]
Agent 89.568125 97.231500 yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent
Customer 91.302875 100.339625 [silence]
Agent 97.231500 105.581750 yeah or any any kind of quality package right i me[an]- it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses
Customer 100.339625 103.534750 really in health care uh-huh
Customer 103.534750 112.743000 [silence]
Agent 105.581750 113.681125 and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations
Customer 112.743000 115.612500 uh-huh vacation and
Agent 113.681125 118.386375 also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization
Customer 115.612500 118.896625 [silence]
Agent 118.386375 120.184625 and uh
Customer 118.896625 124.889625 and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits
Agent 120.184625 124.488750 [silence]
Agent 124.488750 138.157000 i y[ou]- you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them_1 i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um
Customer 124.889625 135.013500 [silence]
Customer 135.013500 139.729500 uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without
Agent 138.157000 149.447875 um typically let's see uh typically the myself i- i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in t[o]- for them to be covered but it was pretty economical
Customer 139.729500 147.537500 [silence]
Customer 147.537500 150.210625 um-hum um-hum
Agent 149.447875 153.779875 um especially relative to just buying your own health care package
Customer 150.210625 152.242125 [silence]
Customer 152.242125 155.031750 right that really gets prohibitive
Agent 153.779875 165.084625 yeah and so you kn[ow]- so that's that's handy uh you know i think that i[t]- i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead
Customer 155.031750 171.219625 [silence]
Agent 165.084625 172.376625 uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary
Customer 171.219625 173.600750 yes i've heard that too
Agent 172.376625 175.878875 and [laughter] which is which is pretty amazing
Customer 173.600750 174.892375 [silence]
Customer 174.892375 183.345250 it is e[specially]- especially if you consider in some situations people might actually use [laughter-that] [laughter-much] hopefully they budget for that and it doesn't get used up entirely but
Agent 175.878875 182.307375 [silence]
Agent 182.307375 183.728875 um-hum
Customer 183.345250 184.652375 [silence]
Agent 183.728875 194.642250 [silence]
Customer 184.652375 189.582000 it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um
Customer 189.582000 199.328125 my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't
Agent 194.642250 195.987500 um-hum
Agent 195.987500 204.512750 [silence]
Customer 199.328125 206.080250 he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the [laughter-security] of an organization's benefits
Agent 204.512750 211.938375 i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that
Customer 206.080250 211.389375 [silence]
Customer 211.389375 224.614000 i[t]- it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand
Agent 211.938375 223.770750 [silence]
Agent 223.770750 225.051750 um-hum
Customer 224.614000 231.001625 um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it
Agent 225.051750 230.266875 [silence]
Agent 230.266875 232.071625 right are
Customer 231.001625 236.043500 the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical
Agent 232.071625 234.223750 [silence]
Agent 234.223750 244.194000 oh well um-hum yeah that's goo[d]- i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think
Customer 236.043500 242.294250 [silence]
Customer 242.294250 243.623000 yeah
Customer 243.623000 251.522000 [silence]
Agent 244.194000 250.857375 um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking
Agent 250.857375 258.056375 [silence]
Customer 251.522000 263.940125 you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh
Agent 258.056375 259.373250 um-hum
Agent 259.373250 266.306875 [silence]
Customer 263.940125 270.410875 a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer
Agent 266.306875 268.958000 oh uh-huh copayment uh uh-huh
Agent 268.958000 276.350750 [silence]
Customer 270.410875 280.025500 so as as of this date [laughter] my husband and my kids are free because_1 they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if
Agent 276.350750 277.646875 right
Agent 277.646875 279.437750 [silence]
Agent 279.437750 281.195250 yeah i- i mean i [vocalized-noise]
Customer 280.025500 295.569750 [silence]
Agent 281.195250 290.857250 typ[ically]- y[ou]- typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um
Agent 290.857250 298.946000 you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping
Customer 295.569750 297.283250 exactly
Customer 297.283250 298.946000 [silence]
