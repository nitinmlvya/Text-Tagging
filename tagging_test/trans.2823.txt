Customer 143.866500 174.868250 [silence]
Agent 154.416125 155.912500 uh
Agent 155.912500 164.346250 but on the budget we of course we haven't really gotten into trouble by not having a budget yet i can see definitely see that there is a need for one though
Agent 164.346250 174.230000 and probably as my daughter gets a little bit older and we start getting involved in in other major purchases and things like that we'll have to do that
Agent 174.230000 182.124750 [silence]
Customer 174.868250 189.647875 uh it's it's kind of a good thing with my husband's company we can allot a certain amount of money and all of our we have four children each of our children have a savings account and then there's a basic savings account like a family one

Agent 211.216125 212.849500 um-hum
Customer 211.997125 218.391000 but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings
Agent 212.849500 225.325000 [silence]
Customer 218.391000 231.220750 it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's [laughter-you] [laughter-know] but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not going to touch that so
Agent 225.325000 226.821750 yeah
Agent 226.821750 228.317125 [silence]

Customer 238.606500 239.767625 yeah [noise]
Agent 239.575500 251.944875 but that's the only one we touch everything else we have we have promised each other we will not touch anything else in fact like CDs and money markets and all kind of stuff we've got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it
Customer 239.767625 250.900500 [silence]
Customer 250.900500 252.936125 i think that's great

Customer 265.973375 267.174000 [silence]
Customer 267.174000 279.161875 yeah we don't touch the kids we do have the joint one like you said and we do fluctuate money in that one if we want to and then there's one other thing that we have and and we don't touch the money in that one
Agent 267.531500 269.109500 [silence]
Agent 269.109500 270.575125 [noise]
Agent 270.575125 279.253500 [silence]
Customer 279.161875 280.358750 so
Agent 279.253500 285.648250 yeah we do the same for our daughter we have uh of course when she was born we just took you know a lump sum of money and put it in a C D
Customer 280.358750 284.566625 [silence]
Customer 284.566625 287.924500 um-hum that's really good
Agent 285.648250 292.464375 as one one means and then we took i take a hundred dollar savings bond out of every paycheck
Customer 287.924500 291.763125 [silence]
Customer 291.763125 293.677750 that's good
Agent 292.464375 303.641875 that's goes directly for for her and then we also have a savings account which we do put X number of dollars in per month which is able to at least build her education fund
Customer 293.677750 303.149000 [silence]
Customer 303.149000 309.048750 you know and that's so important because today things can be so expensive they really can
Agent 303.641875 308.327500 [silence]
Agent 308.327500 318.979625 well if you if you really look at it the kids that are are born today by the time it's college time which will be it will be cost prohibitive if if parents don't do it
Customer 309.048750 318.164000 [silence]
Customer 318.164000 320.092875 that's right exactly
Agent 318.979625 323.601875 kids cannot make money that much money in in that time frame
Customer 320.092875 326.635375 [silence]
Agent 323.601875 327.227125 uh working odd jobs to pay for that kind of bill
Customer 326.635375 332.356500 it's just not possible to do it like maybe we did it when when we went to school
Agent 327.227125 330.696375 [silence]
Agent 330.696375 331.920625 yeah
Agent 331.920625 340.294375 and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because_1 i don't i just don't think it's going to be there
Customer 332.356500 339.376125 [silence]
Customer 339.376125 340.571875 yeah
Agent 340.294375 345.066625 so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there
Customer 340.571875 341.970875 it's too hard
Customer 341.970875 344.249875 [silence]
Customer 344.249875 345.450250 that's right
Agent 345.066625 346.796500 and uh
Customer 345.450250 349.031625 [silence]
Agent 346.796500 358.172750 who knows how much that's going to take i mean what we're taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra
Customer 349.031625 350.194625 [noise]
Customer 350.194625 351.378375 [silence]
Customer 351.378375 354.015625 yeah yeah exactly
Customer 354.015625 360.439625 [silence]
Agent 358.172750 359.575125 then she can go to
Agent 359.575125 364.329000 dental school or any or anything else that she wants to do from from there so
Customer 360.439625 362.469875 wouldn't that be great
Customer 362.469875 365.245750 [silence]
Agent 364.329000 390.278125 [silence]
Customer 365.245750 374.731500 i think that all of those things are really important and and uh the only reason i even went to a budget was i found that we
Customer 374.731500 376.489750 um
Customer 376.489750 381.251500 we would oh i can't think of the word like
Customer 381.251500 383.270000 [silence]
Customer 383.270000 395.706375 or money would go through the cracks you know and at the end of the thing we'd go what happened to all that money the extra we had the overflow you know and it just siphons itself away somewhere into the air [laughter] and so
Agent 390.278125 391.488500 um-hum
Agent 391.488500 394.561625 [silence]
Agent 394.561625 409.125000 well you know i- i y[ou]- you brought up a real good point because_1 i because_1 i notice we do that occasionally we'll get it we'll get down and think where does all this go we just went out on a f[rivolous]- on a on a f[rivolous]- you know like a frivolous spending binge all of a sudden you know and now where did it go
Customer 395.706375 400.951000 [silence]
Customer 400.951000 403.005250 yeah yeah
Customer 403.005250 407.940000 [silence]
Customer 407.940000 410.114250 it's hard to keep track isn't it
Agent 409.125000 414.235500 it is uh uh because_1 i know we we have gotten ourselves into that predicament a few times
Customer 410.114250 413.501750 [silence]
Customer 413.501750 414.644375 um-hum
Agent 414.235500 423.563000 but we've always managed you know to you know to get out of it fairly quickly we don't have a lot charged up on credit cards we don't have you know a lot of money going out
Customer 414.644375 417.252125 [silence]
Customer 417.252125 418.295375 right
Customer 418.295375 420.236125 [silence]
Customer 420.236125 422.288000 i think that's great
Customer 422.288000 432.374250 [silence]
Agent 423.563000 434.635500 uh than what we can pay for but i think if you do have a budget at least then maybe you'll have extra money sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a little bit more important
Customer 432.374250 434.049000 yeah
Customer 434.049000 447.368625 i didn't used to have uh a money allotted out for debt service until um i just had a baby seven months ago and she had extensive problems and
Agent 434.635500 464.059500 [silence]
Customer 447.368625 459.854250 and [laughter] the the specialists and the hospitals that she had to have you know uh she was in the hospital for like a month and the money that accumulated in those i found i had to make
Customer 459.854250 465.459500 that into the budget to start paying those off and th[en]- i mean the insurance
Agent 464.059500 466.097750 oh isn't that something
Customer 465.459500 466.448750 pardon
Agent 466.097750 469.090250 i say isn't that something about_1 medical bills golly
Customer 466.448750 467.231000 [silence]
Customer 467.231000 468.606250 yeah
Customer 468.606250 471.013125 [silence]
Agent 469.090250 471.886625 i know just one little one little hiccup
Customer 471.013125 472.797000 [laughter-yeah]
Agent 471.886625 474.312750 will just about devastate you
Customer 472.797000 474.354125 [silence]
Agent 474.312750 477.127375 [silence]
Customer 474.354125 478.047375 our insurance was wonderful but it didn't cover everything you know and so
Agent 477.127375 478.035000 [noise]
Agent 478.035000 479.286875 yeah
Customer 478.047375 485.118625 yeah fine you have to um do some of those things and and when money is involved it can really get expensive
Agent 479.286875 484.159875 [silence]
Agent 484.159875 485.474750 um
Customer 485.118625 492.126625 so anyway that's about how we handle our finances and and uh that seems to work pretty well for us
Agent 485.474750 491.647125 [silence]
Agent 491.647125 497.961375 yeah i keep pretty extensive records on on you know what i do and i average out you know utilities and things like that
Customer 492.126625 494.961625 [silence]
Customer 494.961625 496.108500 um-hum
Customer 496.108500 506.882625 [silence]
Agent 497.961375 502.897250 i- i project ahead i usually at the end of the month when i when i pay the bills i'll usually
Agent 502.897250 510.068375 project what i'm going to need for next month but i don't really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think it's going to come to and then
Customer 506.882625 508.467000 yeah
Customer 508.467000 509.551500 [silence]
Customer 509.551500 516.648000 well see even that i think is a sort of uh a budget uh when you do that right right
Agent 510.068375 513.533625 [silence]
Agent 513.533625 525.875000 in some basic sense but i think a planned budget i think is is a real good idea so you just break it down in little subgroups and then you have X number of dollars what you think is adequate to pay those bills
Customer 516.648000 524.925125 [silence]
Customer 524.925125 526.233625 um-hum
Agent 525.875000 528.286875 now do you save all your receipts

Customer 541.455000 550.515250 uh we pay for check or else we take out of ATM services you know a certain amount of money and i write every check down
Customer 550.515250 559.387250 for the amount of money or whoever takes money out of the ATM i write down that amount of money and as it comes through uh o[n]- on the statement
Customer 559.387250 571.649875 then i'll b[lock]- block it off in in a bright color so we know it's gone and i can see what's left out and what's left over to come through the statement to make sure that we don't overdraw ourselves or anything
Customer 571.649875 577.025875 but uh that's the way i do it uh receipts were a big mess for me i can't do that
