Customer 369.008500 370.954625 and uh
Customer 370.954625 380.469000 the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annu[ity]- an annuity and uh
Agent 378.695750 380.465125 uh-huh
Agent 380.465125 395.341250 [silence]
Customer 380.469000 385.248625 they would uh you know analyze it
Customer 385.248625 390.982375 the person's current policy and get a compu[terized]- computerized you know statement of
Customer 390.982375 402.493875 uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the the term life with annuity and the whole life
Agent 395.341250 398.051625 uh-huh
Agent 398.051625 431.997500 [silence]
Customer 402.493875 411.754625 was you know there's fairly big dis[crepancies]- discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end
Customer 411.754625 418.492875 and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but
Customer 418.492875 426.762250 uh so i know a little about_1 uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but
Customer 426.762250 439.982750 you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty thou[sands]- or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to to
Agent 431.997500 435.523750 [laughter]
Agent 435.523750 438.485250 [silence]
Agent 438.485250 441.967125 until you get your dependents it just doesn't matter
Customer 439.982750 450.997375 yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you don't want to be a burden to anybody else uh
Agent 441.967125 446.987000 [silence]
Agent 446.987000 448.487875 yeah right

Customer 450.997375 452.791250 and uh
Agent 451.943500 458.485500 but as far as being able to really leave anything
Customer 452.791250 454.510375 so i think

Customer 455.901125 464.538625 yeah i mean i'm not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount uh and you know that's fine but uh

Agent 492.963875 505.265250 [silence]
Customer 494.679375 499.481000 what else is im[portant]- important uh obviously i think uh
Customer 499.481000 502.735250 a profit sharing is is uh
Customer 502.735250 509.692250 is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term
Agent 505.265250 506.786375 i've never
Agent 506.786375 508.997125 [silence]

Agent 518.477125 525.985125 i'd really like it if my company did [laughter] they turn quite a profit at times but
Agent 525.985125 531.460625 it's not part of uh what's available so
Customer 529.435750 532.489250 yeah there's the smaller the the companies it's either
Agent 531.460625 538.653875 [silence]

Agent 544.189125 545.736125 um-hum
Customer 544.479875 548.765750 um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing
Agent 545.736125 565.498500 [silence]
Customer 548.765750 550.494375 um
Customer 550.494375 555.473500 but um most you know most medium or small
