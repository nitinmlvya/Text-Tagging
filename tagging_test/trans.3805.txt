Agent 16.939750 24.432750 [silence]
Agent 24.432750 27.750000 well how does this grab you how does this grab you
Customer 24.525500 26.271500 it's staggering
Customer 26.271500 50.660625 [silence]
Agent 27.750000 34.507375 um this i- i mean i'm i'm a lady but this i heard this on a Christian program and it was
Agent 34.507375 40.057000 uh about the NEA and that's the National Endowment for Arts and they fund
Agent 40.057000 50.712625 they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money
Customer 50.660625 55.129000 well there are a lot of things that people i think generally
Agent 50.712625 53.704625 [silence]
Agent 53.704625 56.984375 and then it just frosts me terribly
Customer 55.129000 56.187375 [silence]
Customer 56.187375 60.235375 well i think it's interesting to look at um
Agent 56.984375 65.649625 [silence]
Customer 60.235375 70.075000 where the money [vocalized-noise] goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is
Agent 65.649625 67.345625 absolutely
Agent 67.345625 80.145500 [silence]
Customer 70.075000 81.559750 that [noise] we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with
Agent 80.145500 82.367750 i believe that's true yes
Customer 81.559750 92.211625 and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us
Agent 82.367750 91.526500 [silence]
Agent 91.526500 93.068750 that's correct
Customer 92.211625 98.566375 i mean and i think it's gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh
Agent 93.068750 97.049375 [silence]
Agent 97.049375 99.439750 heavy involvement from the public
Customer 98.566375 102.319750 yeah right that's y[our]- i think that's the only thing that's gonna change it a[nd]-
Agent 99.439750 100.845000 um-hum
Agent 100.845000 103.854625 yeah heavy involvement from the public
Customer 102.319750 107.475625 o[ur]- our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part
Agent 103.854625 105.679500 yeah
Agent 105.679500 119.759625 [silence]
Customer 107.475625 120.610250 um i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society uh there's very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off
Agent 119.759625 121.556000 absolutely
Customer 120.610250 127.888500 eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyer's uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting
Agent 121.556000 147.732500 [silence]
Customer 127.888500 135.304875 [noise] which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special
Customer 135.304875 145.073875 focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve
Customer 145.073875 148.682000 that's not a formula for a better society
Agent 147.732500 151.107625 no it is not it's lopsided very much so
Customer 148.682000 149.983625 [silence]
Customer 149.983625 153.152875 and the government really plays a role in this
Agent 151.107625 152.318625 [silence]
Agent 152.318625 154.998375 uh-huh that's right they pull the strings
Customer 153.152875 154.657750 [silence]
Customer 154.657750 160.720125 i mean [vocalized-noise] w[ell]- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful inter[est]-
Agent 154.998375 159.560875 [silence]
Agent 159.560875 161.761500 right the yeah [laughter]
Customer 160.720125 161.726250 [silence]
Customer 161.726250 168.793000 you know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not
Agent 161.761500 195.898500 [silence]
Customer 168.793000 173.572250 likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting
Customer 173.572250 184.505375 but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair and when they recognize it's their tax money they're gonna do more about it
Customer 184.505375 191.496375 i th[ink]- i'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line
Customer 191.496375 197.928500 an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country they expect
Agent 195.898500 197.254875 um-hum
Agent 197.254875 202.183250 [silence]
Customer 197.928500 203.161875 [noise] opening it for one hour that they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls
Agent 202.183250 203.983375 i'm sure they will
Customer 203.161875 211.580000 and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to p[ut]- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government
Agent 203.983375 210.863375 [silence]
Agent 210.863375 212.217625 um-hum
Customer 211.580000 225.670250 like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then
Agent 212.217625 213.785250 [silence]
Agent 213.785250 215.336250 uh-huh
Agent 215.336250 247.509625 [silence]
Customer 225.670250 240.394000 i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look
Customer 240.394000 248.303250 do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art
Agent 247.509625 255.257500 yes i understand that but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it
Customer 248.303250 254.551500 [silence]
Customer 254.551500 265.354000 [noise] well that's the good thing about what is happening because_1 i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it [noise] is telling us m[ore]- you know about the problems
Agent 255.257500 273.605375 [silence]
Customer 265.354000 274.267750 so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country
Agent 273.605375 275.467875 oh absolutely
Customer 274.267750 276.997125 over a very long period of time
Agent 275.467875 278.326625 right absolutely
Customer 276.997125 280.245500 um and uh
Agent 278.326625 283.729250 we only see the tip of the iceberg it's only you know there's so much
Customer 280.245500 282.680250 [laughter-right]
Customer 282.680250 284.437500 yeah
Agent 283.729250 291.102625 of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture
Customer 284.437500 290.397375 [silence]
Customer 290.397375 299.554000 [laughter] well you may be right [vocalized-noise] what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a
Agent 291.102625 299.554000 [silence]
