Customer 4.765875 7.723125 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] me too [laughter]
Customer 7.723125 32.014375 [silence]
Agent 9.281750 16.886000 had a tremendously organized budget i've you know kind of know how much the monthly bills are by
Agent 16.886000 23.395625 you know looking at the previous month and i know about_1 what the minimum payments are so i just kind of put it down on paper and
Agent 23.395625 34.099500 and estimate but as far as actually having a real tight uh organized budget that you stay within i've i've just always kind of freelanced as far as that goes
Customer 32.014375 35.443625 boy me too it's uh fly by the seat of my pants
Agent 34.099500 64.776375 [silence]
Customer 35.443625 42.325125 uh in the old days when my wife and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it
Customer 42.325125 53.608500 because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and
Customer 53.608500 58.779250 and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly
Customer 58.779250 63.210125 but uh that was for about the first uh eighteen years of our marriage
Customer 63.210125 66.691750 then she dropped out of the work force and uh
Agent 64.776375 66.567000 [noise]

Customer 83.408000 87.215875 [silence]

Customer 90.284250 96.998125 forty two yeah most most of my friends have uh children uh y[ou]- who are having children it seems like
Agent 91.090750 92.629750 and
Agent 92.629750 98.397375 [silence]
Customer 96.998125 99.257250 but uh we [vocalized-noise]
Agent 98.397375 106.413000 we actually ran one checkbook with i mean one account with two checkbooks off the same account for a l[ong]- for a long time
Customer 99.257250 105.654125 [silence]
Customer 105.654125 106.717625 um-hum
Agent 106.413000 120.475500 but that's real dangerous when one is supposed to make a deposit and doesn't or or writes an extra couple of checks and either forgets to tell the other one about [laughter-it] [laughter-or] [laughter-something] you know so we finally switched to
Customer 106.717625 107.854125 [silence]
Customer 107.854125 108.797750 yeah
Customer 108.797750 122.312875 [silence]
Agent 120.475500 123.841000 the two method too it seemed to work better
Customer 122.312875 132.501750 yeah i think wh[en]- uh uh when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was uh more of a sense of respectful responsibility
Agent 123.841000 137.953000 [silence]
Customer 132.501750 138.030750 uh [noise] it almost demanded coordination in splitting up bills and stuff
Agent 137.953000 139.393000 oh sure
Customer 138.030750 147.646875 now it's my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and uh uh it doesn't i'm not being critical but my wife kind of has
Agent 139.393000 156.652125 [silence]
Customer 147.646875 150.761500 the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check
Customer 150.761500 157.948000 you know and it's unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but it's almost that attitude
Agent 156.652125 163.283750 you still got checks you still got money right [laughter]
Customer 157.948000 163.457000 yeah right yeah [laughter-that's] [laughter-yeah] that's kind of how it comes out
Agent 163.283750 173.886375 well we been we each have our own business and so especially once that got established it was easier for her to run her deal and me to run mine and uh not really
Customer 163.457000 164.683500 uh
Customer 164.683500 172.223375 [silence]
Customer 172.223375 173.264000 um
Customer 173.264000 193.912500 [silence]
Agent 173.886375 178.466125 mix the two and uh the you know bills that are
Agent 178.466125 187.955125 if we're both paying on a certain thing like the a school tuition then one or of the other of us writes the other one a check for their portion
Agent 187.955125 194.285125 and then one person mails it all you know to the to the bank or whoever
Customer 193.912500 195.115250 um-hum
Agent 194.285125 202.938625 if it's something we're doing that way if it's uh if it's something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then then we just pay it like you do
Customer 195.115250 202.602750 [silence]
Customer 202.602750 209.955000 yeah well ho[w]- how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know do you uh
Agent 202.938625 210.911750 [silence]
Customer 209.955000 220.711000 in our in our case it's more of a a philosophy like you know for the next few months we're really going to watch it and we'll t[ry]- try to control the big thing[s]-
Agent 210.911750 211.823000 well
Agent 211.823000 218.116000 [silence]
Agent 218.116000 227.357625 uh it's kind of the way it is it's it's never been uh like my brother is organized to the {n-th} degree he and i are exactly opposite he's two years younger than i am and
Customer 220.711000 228.861625 [silence]
Agent 227.357625 237.085625 he budgets every penny he knows where every little thing is and he's a real tight wad with uh the money and i've always been a little looser
Customer 228.861625 229.850250 um-hum
Customer 229.850250 236.078750 [silence]
Customer 236.078750 238.198375 well that's how we both are
Agent 237.085625 245.502250 and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and and not spend any you know big amounts of money uh
Customer 238.198375 245.695000 [silence]
Agent 245.502250 253.822125 during a a certain period of time if we got a little excess and decide to splurge and buy something you know then that's kind of a joint
Customer 245.695000 247.648625 yeah we we
Customer 247.648625 255.077125 [silence]
Agent 253.822125 256.113625 thing too so
Customer 255.077125 260.757250 yeah we went through a period uh well we went through six years of infertility
Agent 256.113625 267.424250 [silence]
Customer 260.757250 270.917125 and it uh it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know eight hundred dollar prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that
Agent 267.424250 269.510375 oh yeah those are
Agent 269.510375 293.189875 [silence]
Customer 270.917125 282.977125 [noise] and my wife was working at the time so i[t]- it and most of it was you know reimbursable on insurance so we had you know big cash flow and it was a little bit of a management problem but it wasn't too difficult with the two incomes
Customer 282.977125 290.831750 and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldn't have children so we sort of indulged and we
Customer 290.831750 296.337750 uh leased some expensive cars and took a vacation yeah it
Agent 293.189875 294.996750 that'll do it everytime
Agent 294.996750 298.850000 you immediately get pregnant if you do that [laughter]
Customer 296.337750 298.850000 well that's what exactly what happened yeah w[e]-
