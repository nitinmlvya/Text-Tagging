2327,Agent 265.211125 273.500375 i've heard a lot of different arguments uh pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales tax or even uh,Taxes
2327,Agent 273.500375 284.470375 maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when you think about it the people that purchase more items are the ones that are better able to pay the taxes,Taxes

2327,Agent 299.771875 309.613625 uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and they're out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um,Taxes
2327,Agent 309.613625 317.048125 there wa[s]- there's another crazy thing that gets me it's like the more children you have the less tax you pay,Taxes
2327,Agent 317.048125 329.644000 and to me that is completely crazy and i have five children so i mean you know i uh i you know it it's kind of odd when i talk about this with other people because it it just doesn't make sense to me you're getting more services,Taxes

2327,Customer 349.740500 360.172000 i guess the you know the idea is that uh the more people you have in the family the more allowances you need you know the more uh capability you need to uh to,Taxes
2327,Customer 360.172000 366.210250 pay for food and clothing and stuff for them so the they give you more allowances more dependent allowances for that,Taxes

4070,Agent 122.501875 127.947500 you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh,Taxes
4070,Agent 127.947500 133.049500 uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well,Taxes
4070,Customer 131.784625 141.678125 my my feeling about at least i I don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here,Taxes
4070,Agent 133.049500 175.378875 [silence],Taxes
4070,Customer 141.678125 146.103000 uh some of the public schools get more funds than,Taxes
4070,Customer 146.103000 157.064125 the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student,Taxes
4070,Customer 157.064125 159.413000 but the best private school,Taxes
4070,Customer 159.413000 172.355375 is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money,Taxes
4070,Customer 172.355375 177.665750 just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and,Taxes
4070,Agent 175.378875 186.136125 well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff,Taxes
4070,Customer 177.665750 180.828875 [silence],Taxes
4070,Customer 180.828875 181.835125 [laughter],Taxes

4070,Customer 186.132250 194.105875 yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um,Taxes
4070,Agent 186.136125 229.305750 [silence],Taxes
4070,Customer 194.105875 198.365375 uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which,Taxes
4070,Customer 198.365375 209.315500 all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction,Taxes
4070,Customer 209.315500 216.191375 meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up,Taxes
4070,Customer 216.191375 223.326750 uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools,Taxes
4070,Customer 223.326750 231.759000 went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh,Taxes

4070,Customer 239.294750 244.362750 yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh,Taxes

4070,Customer 244.362750 253.445500 on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending,Taxes

2831,Agent 225.816125 236.753875 but uh uh seems like every time that uh people begin to make a little money at that and a lot of people jumped on IRAs i mean you di[d]- you app[arently]- you apparently did and a lot of people i know did too,Taxes
2831,Customer 235.050375 240.132875 oh i still do contribute to an IRA even though i can't take advantage of any tax breaks,Taxes

2831,Customer 380.054750 388.769500 three percent of yeah three percent of their mo[rtgage]- mortgage right now or or of the uh principal that's left on their loan is uh a significant chunk of change,Taxes

4372,Customer 1.048625 21.531625 [silence],Taxes
4372,Agent 8.740375 19.530875 and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it,Taxes
4372,Agent 19.530875 22.845750 what do you think is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there,Taxes
4372,Customer 21.531625 32.428250 well actually i don't think they're out of line De[vil's]- Devil's advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and wheth[er]- whether or not you agree with that law,Taxes

4372,Agent 47.261750 77.358625 [silence],Taxes
4372,Customer 47.285750 61.350250 uh really i- i- i don't think that's a valid argument i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax um s[ome]- naturally some some things you just can't find in your local KMart or or [noise] um,Taxes
4372,Customer 61.350250 64.791250 Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but,Taxes
4372,Customer 64.791250 77.367250 th[en]- th[en]- then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax,Taxes
4372,Agent 77.358625 79.790750 well i mean it seems to me that,Taxes
4372,Customer 77.367250 89.448625 [silence],Taxes
4372,Agent 79.790750 88.286000 generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania it's because,Taxes
4372,Agent 88.286000 100.012000 i'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uh it's because i- i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that,Taxes

4372,Agent 100.012000 107.265250 and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed,Taxes
4372,Agent 107.265250 115.741375 even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer,Taxes
4372,Customer 115.609500 119.418375 i i'll agree it it's not your responsibility but,Taxes
4372,Agent 115.741375 148.319250 [silence],Taxes
4372,Customer 119.418375 122.720250 i[s]- b[ut]- is it also legal,Taxes
4372,Customer 122.720250 135.558750 for you to do that w[hat]- w[hat]- fr[om]- from what i understand from v[arious]- v[arious]- various net readings i[t]- i[t]- it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state,Taxes
4372,Customer 135.558750 149.083000 tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states c[an]- can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that w[ill]- do your arguments still apply,Taxes
4372,Agent 148.319250 161.681250 well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion,Taxes
4372,Customer 149.083000 173.505375 [silence],Taxes
4372,Agent 161.681250 174.362500 then i don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need [noise] to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania,Taxes
4372,Customer 173.505375 176.632125 which is exactly what businesses do at the present,Taxes
4372,Agent 174.362500 175.996375 [silence],Taxes
4372,Agent 175.996375 190.051125 right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer,Taxes
4372,Customer 176.632125 187.329250 [silence],Taxes

4372,Customer 196.249125 204.815000 that's my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesn't pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay,Taxes
4372,Customer 204.815000 210.581500 and there r[easons]- there are s[ome]- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that,Taxes
4372,Agent 209.907000 218.987500 uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax,Taxes

4372,Customer 238.639000 244.480750 uh i think that [noise] i think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania and i know they work that way in uh say here in DC,Taxes

4372,Agent 254.982875 264.719500 um but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that,Taxes
4372,Agent 264.719500 272.233000 um the opportunity f[or]- to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided,Taxes

4372,Customer 272.967000 286.716375 that's true i[s]- i[s]- a r[eal]- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i- i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a [noise] a a loss i- i think,Taxes
4372,Customer 286.716375 298.466000 is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism jus[t]- just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue that's being lost um and i- i don't know if i agree with that but it b[ut]-,Taxes
